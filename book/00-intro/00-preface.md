# Purpose
This book aims to explain the basics of relational database programming, focusing on scientific data that relies on complex computations.
It is written for anyone interested in learning the fundemantals of relational database programming, focusing on solid theoretical foundations.

This guide provides an introduction to database programming in scientific settings. You'll learn how databases can help organize and manage the complex data involved in collaborative scientific research.

Scientific databases must large numerical datasets and complex data structures. But it's not just about storing data. The data needs to work smoothly with the computational algorithms that process and interpret it. This requires effective code management and automation of computations across different computing systems.

# DataJoint vs. SQL
There are many ways to manage data, but relational databases are highly regarded for their structured approach.
They help maintain data accuracy and offer powerful tools for querying data. The main language used in relational databases is SQL, which covers data definition, querying, modification, and procedural tasks.

SQL, developed in the 70s and 80s, is still widely used, but it can be complex. That’s where DataJoint comes in—a modern take on the relational model, tailored for the scientific community.
Like SQL, DataJoint provides tools for defining, manipulating, and querying data. The beauty of DataJoint is its simplicity, making it easier to learn database programming without getting too deep into SQL’s complexities.

This guide explains the principles and uses of relational databases, using DataJoint in Python as the primary language for database interactions.
It includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, exercises, and resources.
However, all examples will be also explained using SQL, introducing its essential syntax and concepts.
Therefore, this book can be used to learn SQL, although in a somewhat opinionated flavor.

# Additional Resources
This book provides a comprehensive tutorial for programming scientific databases using DataJoint from Python.
The book  provides equivalent SQL
If you are using this book to learn SQL programming, then we recommend supplementing your reading with additional learning resources for a more thorough treatment of SQL.

# Focus on Neuroscience
The tools and concepts in this book are general to all data-rich and computation-intensive disciplines.
Yet the history of DataJoint and its most common applications stem from the field of systems neuroscience.
This may explain a neuroscience focus of some of the examples in the book.
