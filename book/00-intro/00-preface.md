# Purpose

This book offers a clear and comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of relational database programming, with a specific focus on scientific data that relies on complex computations. It is designed for anyone interested in building a strong theoretical foundation in relational database programming, particularly in the context of managing and analyzing scientific data.

In this guide, you’ll explore how databases can be used to organize and manage the intricate data involved in collaborative scientific research. Scientific databases often handle large numerical datasets and complex data structures. However, it's not just about data storage; the data must integrate seamlessly with computational algorithms that process and interpret it. This necessitates effective code management and the automation of computations across different computing systems.

# DataJoint vs. SQL

There are various methods for managing data, but relational databases stand out for their structured approach. They maintain data accuracy and provide powerful tools for querying information. The primary language used in relational databases is SQL, which encompasses data definition, querying, modification, and procedural tasks.

Although SQL, developed in the 1970s and 1980s, remains widely used, it can be challenging to master. This is where DataJoint comes in—a modern implementation of the relational model, specifically tailored for the scientific community. Like SQL, DataJoint offers tools for defining, manipulating, and querying data. However, DataJoint’s simplicity makes it easier to learn database programming without delving too deeply into the complexities of SQL.

This guide explores the principles and applications of relational databases using DataJoint in Python as the primary language for database interactions. It includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, exercises, and resources. Additionally, all examples will be explained using SQL, introducing its essential syntax and concepts. Therefore, this book can also serve as a resource for learning SQL, albeit with a specific focus.

# Additional Resources

This book provides a comprehensive tutorial on programming scientific databases using DataJoint from Python. While the book includes equivalent SQL examples, those who wish to learn SQL programming in greater depth are encouraged to supplement their reading with additional resources for a more thorough understanding of SQL.

# Focus on Neuroscience

The tools and concepts presented in this book are applicable to all data-rich and computation-intensive disciplines. However, the origins of DataJoint and its most common applications are rooted in systems neuroscience. As a result, some examples in the book may have a neuroscience focus.
