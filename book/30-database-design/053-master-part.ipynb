    "\n",
    "1. **Master tables are declared normally** The master entity is declared as any regular table by subclassing `dj.Manual`/`dj.Lookup`/`dj.Imported`/`dj.Computed`. Thus a table becomes a master table by virtue of having part tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nested class definition** – Parts are declared as a nested class inside its master class, subclassing `dj.Part`. Thus the part tables are referred to by their full class name such as `Polygon.Vertex`.  Their classes do not need to be wrapped the the `@schema` decorator: the decorated of the master class is responsible for declaring all of its parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Foreign key from part to master** The part tables declare a foreign key to its master directly or transitively through other parts. Inside the namespace of the master class a special object named `master` can be used to reference to the master table. Thus the definition of the `Vertex` table can declare the foreign key `-> master` as an equivalent alias to `-> Polygon` --- either will form a valid foreign key. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Diagram notation** – In schema diagrams, part tables are rendered without colored blocks. They appear as labels attached to the master node, emphasizing that they do not stand on their own. The absence of color also highlights that other tables rarely reference parts directly; the master represents the entity identity.\n",

   "source": "## Workflow semantics\n\nMaster-part relationships are most powerful in auto-computed tables (`dj.Computed` or `dj.Imported`). When a master is populated, DataJoint executes the master's `make()` method inside an atomic transaction. This guarantees that all parts belonging to the master are inserted (or updated) together with the master row. If any part fails to insert, the entire transaction is rolled back, preserving consistency.\n\nThis workflow semantics offers two key benefits:\n\n- **Atomicity** – From the points of view of other agents accessing the database, every master row is all-or-nothing. Either the master and all its parts appear together, or none of them do. Partially populated entries are only visible from inside transactions that create them. Downstream tables can safely depend on the master row, knowing that its parts are already in place.\n- **Isolation** – Any transaction that populates a master and its parts operates on a consistent isolated state of the database. Any changes that ocurr during this transaction will not affect computations of the individual parts. In DataJoint, this is typically already the case if users eschew updates and computations from data outside direct upstream dependencies. \n\nBecause master/part tables are created together, they naturally fit into the [relational workflow model](../20-concepts/04-workflows.md). The master participates in the DAG as a normal node, while the parts are executed inside the same workflow step.\n\n:::{seealso}\nFor a complete computational example demonstrating master-part relationships in an image analysis pipeline, see the [Blob Detection](../80-examples/075-blob-detection.ipynb) example, where `Detection` (master) and `Detection.Blob` (part) capture aggregate blob counts and per-feature coordinates atomically.\n:::"

    "## Practical guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use parts for tightly-coupled detail rows**: If the part data never exists without the master, implement it as a nested part rather than a separate table. Examples include waveform channels, spike units per recording, order lines for a purchase order, or parameter sweeps attached to a model fit.\n",
    "- **Keep part logic inside `make()`**: Populate the master and insert all parts from within the master’s `make()` method. Do not create separate processes that attempt to fill the part tables independently—the transactional guarantees rely on the nesting.\n",
    "- **Diagram awareness**: Remember that part nodes appear without colored blocks in the diagram. Use this visual cue to distinguish between independent entity tables and parts. Diagramming utilities provide the option of hiding all parts for a simplified view.\n"
