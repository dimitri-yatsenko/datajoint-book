    "# Modeling Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll explore how to build complex relationships between entities using a combination of uniqueness constraints and referential constraints. Understanding these patterns is essential for designing schemas that accurately represent business rules and data dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uniqueness Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness constraints are typically set through primary keys, but tables can also have additional unique indexes beyond the primary key. These constraints ensure that specific combinations of attributes remain unique across all rows in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Referential Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential constraints establish relationships between tables and are enforced by [foreign keys](030-foreign-keys.ipynb). They ensure that references between tables remain valid and prevent orphaned records.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreign Keys Establish 1:N or 1:1 Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "When a child table defines a foreign key constraint to a parent table, it creates a relationship between the entities in the parent and child tables. The cardinality of this relationship is always **1 on the parent side**: each entry in the child table must refer to a single entity in the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the child side, the relationship can have different cardinalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **0–1 (optional one-to-one)**: if the foreign key field in the child table has a unique constraint\n",
    "- **1 (mandatory one-to-one)**: if the foreign key is the entire primary key of the child table\n",
    "- **N (one-to-many)**: if no uniqueness constraint is applied to the foreign key field\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores these key relationship patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-to-Many Relationships**: The most common pattern, using foreign keys in secondary attributes\n",
    "* **One-to-One Relationships**: Using primary key foreign keys or unique constraints\n",
    "* **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Using association tables with composite primary keys\n",
    "* **Sequences**: Cascading one-to-one relationships for workflows\n",
    "* **Hierarchies**: Cascading one-to-many relationships for nested data structures\n",
    "* **Parameterization**: Association tables where the association itself is the primary entity\n",
    "* **Directed Graphs**: Self-referencing relationships with renamed foreign keys\n",
    "* **Complex Constraints**: Using nullable enums with unique indexes for special requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by illustrating these possibilities with examples of bank customers and their accounts."

    "* Each customer entry contains a reference to a single account in `Account4`, suggesting that each customer is linked to one specific account.\n",
    "* Since there is no constraint on the number of customers who can point to the same account, this design may allow multiple customers to be associated with a single account, indicating the possibility of shared accounts.\n",

    "\n",

    "* **Unified Identity:** Since `Account5` shares the primary key with `Customer5`, each `Account5` record is uniquely identified by the same key as `Customer5`.\n",
    "This enforces the rule that each account cannot exist without an associated customer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Keep Separate Tables?\n",
    "Although this design could allow us to simply merge all account-related data into the `Customer5` table, there are reasons we may choose to keep `Account5` as a separate table:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity and Clarity**: Separating `Account5` from `Customer5` keeps the structure modular, which can clarify different aspects of customer and account data in queries and during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Management**: By keeping account information in a separate table, we can manage and update account-related data independently from customer information. This separation can be beneficial for tasks such as auditing, logging, or updating fields associated with only account data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Optional Fields**: In cases where certain fields are only relevant to accounts (e.g., open_date, account-specific details), keeping them in a separate table prevents having unused or irrelevant fields in the main `Customer5` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access Control**: When account information is sensitive or needs restricted access, placing it in a separate table can simplify access control, allowing finer-grained security policies around account data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability and Maintenance**: Over time, this separation can support scalability as customer and account data expand. If we anticipate adding extensive account-specific data or if account records will be managed differently from customer records, the separate tables facilitate maintenance and future-proof the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Schema Evolution**: Separate tables provide flexibility to adapt or expand either the Customer5 or Account5 table independently, without altering the other table. This flexibility is especially useful if the schema is expected to evolve over time."

    "\n",
    "By examining the diagrams above, only one (`schema5`) clearly shows a one-to-one relationship through its **thick solid line**. Here's how to interpret the diagramming notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line Styles:**\n",
    "* **Thick solid line**: One-to-one relationship where the foreign key is the entire primary key of the child table\n",
    "* **Thin solid line**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is part of (but not all of) the primary key \n",
    "* **Dashed line**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is a secondary attribute (not part of primary key)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the Diagram Cannot Show:**\n",
    "* Whether a foreign key is nullable (allows zero or one instead of exactly one)\n",
    "* Secondary unique constraints that convert one-to-many into one-to-one\n",
    "* The diagram only reflects the structure of primary keys and foreign keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip**: In Jupyter notebooks, you can hover over a diagram element to view its full table definition, including any secondary uniqueness constraints and nullable modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice**: DataJoint users generally avoid secondary unique constraints when the primary key structure can enforce uniqueness. Making the foreign key part of the primary key (creating solid lines in diagrams) provides two benefits:\n",
    "1. **Visual clarity**: The relationship type is immediately obvious from the diagram\n",
    "2. **Query simplicity**: Primary keys cascade through foreign keys, enabling direct joins between distant tables in the hierarchy"

    "\n",

    "An M:N relationship can be visualized as two one-to-many (1:N and 1:M) relationships with the association table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The association table contains:\n",
    "* **A foreign key** referencing each of the two related entities, establishing connections to instances of both tables.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Design\n",
    "* **Association Table (`CustomerAccount8`)**: The `CustomerAccount8` association table links `Customer8` and `Account8` through foreign keys. Although it resembles a many-to-many structure, by making the foreign key `-> Customer8` unique (it's the primary key), we ensure that each customer is associated with only one account. However, we leave the `-> Account8` foreign key unconstrained, allowing multiple customers to link to the same account, which enables account sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Versatility of Association Tables\n",
    "While association tables are necessary for modeling many-to-many relationships, they can also model one-to-many and even one-to-one relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished by by altering their primary key or adding additional uniqueness constraints. If the association table links tables `A` and `B`, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One-to-Many: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-> B\n",
    "--- \n",
    "-> A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Any number of `B`s are each matched to at most one `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One-to-One: \n",
    "```\n",
    "-> A\n",
    "---\n",
    "-> [unique] B\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With uniqueness constraints on both `A` and `B`, each entry in `A` is matched to at most one entry in `B` and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many-to-Many\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-> A\n",
    "-> B\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    " Leave both foreign keys in the primary key, allowing each entity to associate freely with multiple instances of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach makes association tables a powerful tool for defining relationships of varying cardinality, adding flexibility and adaptability to DataJoint schemas. By managing uniqueness constraints directly in the association table, you can model complex relationships while keeping the primary entities’ structures simple and intuitive."

    "### Key Features of Hierarchical Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hierarchical design:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cascading Primary Keys**: The primary key from `Study` propagates all the way down to `Func`, creating solid lines in the diagram. This is indicated by the solid (not dashed) connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Direct Joins**: Because the primary keys cascade, you can join any two tables in the hierarchy directly. For example, `Study * Func` is a valid join that doesn't require including `Subject` or `Session` in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-to-Many at Each Level**: Each foreign key creates a one-to-many relationship:\n",
    "  - One study has many subjects\n",
    "  - One subject has many sessions\n",
    "  - One session has many functional scans\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Composite Primary Keys**: Lower tables have composite primary keys that include all ancestor identifiers. For example, a functional scan is uniquely identified by `(study, subject_id, session, func)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design pattern is extremely common in scientific workflows and hierarchical data organization systems.\n"

    "### Understanding the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This design elegantly handles all four requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cities belong to states**: The foreign key `-> State` in the `City` table's primary key ensures each city belongs to exactly one state\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unique capitals**: The `unique index(state, capital)` constraint ensures that for each state, there can be at most one city with `capital='YES'`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Capitals are cities**: Since the capital designation is just an attribute of the `City` table, capitals are by definition cities\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Capitals in the same state**: The `state` field is part of both the foreign key and the unique index, ensuring the capital must be in that state\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Insight**: The nullable enum field `capital = null : enum('YES')` combined with `unique index(state, capital)` is the clever trick. Since the unique index only applies to non-null values, you can have multiple cities with `capital=null` in the same state, but only one city can have `capital='YES'` for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same pattern you would use for modeling teams and team captains, where:\n",
    "- `State` → `Team`\n",
    "- `City` → `Player`\n",
    "- `capital='YES'` → `is_captain='YES'`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We've explored several key relationship patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-to-Many**: Using foreign keys in secondary attributes (dashed lines) or using foreign keys in a composite primary key (solid thin lines). Or use an association table with a unique constraint on one of the foreign keys.\n",
    "* **One-to-One**: Using foreign keys as primary keys (thick solid lines) or in secondary attributes with unique constraints (thin dashed lines)  \n",
    "* **Many-to-Many**: Using association tables with composite primary keys\n",
    "* **Sequences**: Cascading one-to-one relationships for workflows\n",
    "* **Hierarchies**: Cascading one-to-many relationships with expanding primary keys\n",
    "* **Parameterization**: Association tables where the association itself is the entity of interest\n",
    "* **Directed Graphs**: Self-referencing relationships with renamed foreign keys\n",
    "* **Constrained Relationships**: Using nullable enums with unique indexes for special cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these patterns allows you to design schemas that accurately represent complex business rules and data relationships."
