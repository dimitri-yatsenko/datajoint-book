# Data Queries

*Data repositories* are a broad category within data management systems, primarily designed to deposit and fetch data.

```{card} Data retrieval
**Data Retrieval:** The process of fetching data from a *data repository* in its original, deposited form.

Databases, on the other hand, cater to a more diverse user base, each with distinct roles and interests pertaining to their organization or enterprise.  
Catering to these varied needs requires databases to facilitate *data queries*, allowing users to request specific sections of stored data, often in a format that diverges from its original storage format.

```{card} Data Query
A **data query** is a function applied to stored data; it extracts and presents a specified segment of the database's data tailored for a particular analysis.
The output often deviates from the original storage format.
Database systems are equipped with sophisticated tools for defining and executing these precise queries.

Consider a university as an example.
Students need functionalities to enroll in courses and view their academic records.
Instructors, on the other hand, require access to class lists and a platform to input student grades.
Meanwhile, a dean might wish to oversee the academic performance of every student within her department.
Each of these operations, though sourcing from the same foundational data, demands unique selections and combinations of the data.

In contemporary data-driven scientific research, data queries prove invaluable.
They enable researchers to select and aggregate specific data fragments essential for a given analysis or visualization, eliminating the need to retrieve the entirety of a dataset from its primary repository.
