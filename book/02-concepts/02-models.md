# Definition
```{card} Data Model
A *data model* is a particular way of thinking about data. 
A particular model is defined by answering the following questions:
* What is the data made of? What are the basic constructs for creating and manipulating the data?
* What are the basic operations for defining, creating, and manipulating the data?
* What tools exist for defining and enforcing data integrity: the rules for valid data interactions and for preventing invalid operaitons?
```

:::note Thought
Before proceeding, think of the data models you are already familiar with.
What are the building blocks for data in this model?
What are the principal operations for creating, manipulating, and querying data in this model?
:::

# Example: Binary File

# Example: File System

# Example: Spreadsheets

# Example: Object Model

# Schema
Data models can be divided into structured and self-describing.

# Exercise
As an exercise, describe other models you are familiar with in terms of its basic constructs, operations, and data integrity rules.
For example, what data models  are used by the following:

* HDF5 or .MAT files
* Graph databases (
* Vector database
* Document database e.g. MongoDB
