    "\n",
    "DataJoint uses data types provided by its underlying database management system, MySQL. \n",
    "DataJoint also provides its own data types, which we will introduce later.\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL, one of the most popular relational database management systems, supports a variety of data types that are used to define the kind of data that can be stored in a table's columns. Choosing the correct data type is crucial for optimizing performance, storage, and ensuring the accuracy of the data. This section provides an overview of the main MySQL data types, categorized into numeric types, date and time types, string (or character) types, and other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn about the full set of MySQL datatypes in the [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/data-types.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we only list the datatypes commonly used in DataJoint. We will only use these datatypes in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types are used to store numbers. They are divided into integer types, floating-point types, and fixed-point types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer Types**:\n",
    "  - `TINYINT`: A very small integer. Range: -128 to 127 or 0 to 255 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  - `SMALLINT`: A small integer. Range: -32,768 to 32,767 or 0 to 65,535 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  - `INT`: A standard integer. Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or 0 to 4,294,967,295 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  - `BIGINT`: A large integer. Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 or 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Each of these types can be specified as `UNSIGNED` to allow only non-negative values, effectively doubling the upper limit of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Floating-Point Types**:\n",
    "  - `FLOAT`: A floating-point number with M digits in total and D digits after the decimal point. Approximate range is -3.402823466E+38 to 3.402823466E+38.\n",
    "  - `DOUBLE`: A double-precision floating-point number. Approximate range is -1.7976931348623157E+308 to 1.7976931348623157E+308.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed-Point Types**:\n",
    "  - `DECIMAL(M,D)`: A fixed-point number where M is the total number of digits and D is the number of digits after the decimal point. This type is used for exact numeric data (e.g., for monetary values). It can be marked `UNSIGNED` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Date and Time Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Date and time data types are used to store temporal data. These types are essential for tracking dates, times, and intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DATE`: A date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. The range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.\n",
    "- `DATETIME`: A combination of date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. The range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.\n",
    "- `TIMESTAMP`: A timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, representing the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). The range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC.\n",
    "- `TIME`: A time value in the format `HH:MM:SS`. The range is from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'.\n",
    "- `YEAR`: A year in 2-digit or 4-digit format. The range is from '1901' to '2155' for 4-digit format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## String (Character) Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "String data types are used to store text and binary data. These types are flexible and can store anything from a single character to large text blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CHAR(M)`: A fixed-length string that is always padded with spaces to the specified length M. The maximum length is 255 characters.\n",
    "- `VARCHAR(M)`: A variable-length string where M specifies the maximum length. The maximum length is 65,535 characters.\n",
    "- `ENUM`: An enumeration. You can specify a list of permitted values, and the column can store only one of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the correct data type for each column in your table is crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Choose data types that use the least amount of storage while accommodating all possible values. For instance, if you only need to store small numbers, use `TINYINT` instead of `INT`.\n",
    "- **Precision**: Use `DECIMAL` for precise calculations, especially for financial data, instead of `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE`, which are subject to rounding errors.\n",
    "- **Appropriateness**: Match the data type to the nature of the data. For example, use `DATE` for date values, `CHAR` for fixed-length fields like postal codes, and `TEXT` for large text blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding MySQL data types is essential for designing efficient, reliable, and maintainable databases. By choosing the appropriate data types for your columns, you ensure that your database performs well and stores data accurately. This overview provides a solid foundation for selecting the right data types when defining your tables in MySQL.\n"
