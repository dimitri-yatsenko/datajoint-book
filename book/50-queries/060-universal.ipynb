    "# Universal Sets\n",

    "## Understanding Universal Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dj.U()` class creates a universal set—a conceptual table that can be restricted or used in aggregations. Universal sets are not directly fetchable; they serve as operands in query expressions.\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Choose the Right Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- For unique values: `dj.U('attr') & Table`\n",
    "- For total counts/sums: `dj.U().aggr(Table, ...)`\n",
    "- For grouping by non-entity attributes: `dj.U('attr').aggr(Table, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Projection to Create Grouping Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "When grouping by computed values, project them first:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Project to create the grouping attribute\n",
    "with_year = Student.proj(birth_year='YEAR(date_of_birth)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then aggregate by that attribute\n",
    "counts_by_year = dj.U('birth_year').aggr(with_year, n='COUNT(*)')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Understand the Result Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dj.U('attr') & Table` — primary key is `attr`\n",
    "- `dj.U().aggr(...)` — primary key is empty (single-row result)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Combine with Restrictions for Filtered Results\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Unique departments among currently enrolled students\n",
    "active_depts = dj.U('dept') & (Enroll & CurrentTerm)\n",
