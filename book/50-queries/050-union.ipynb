    "# Operator: Union\n",
    "\n",
    "The **union operator** combines rows from two tables that represent the same entity type. It produces a table containing all unique rows from both input tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Union\n",
    "\n",
    "Union **combines rows** from two tables into a single result. Unlike join (which combines columns), union stacks the rows of compatible tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Same entity type**: Both tables must represent the same kind of entity with the same primary key\n",
    "- **Semantic compatibility**: All shared attributes must be semantically matched\n",
    "- **Deduplication**: Duplicate rows (based on primary key) are included only once\n",
    "- **Algebraic closure**: The result has the same primary key as the input tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Combine rows from two tables\n",
    "result = TableA + TableB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `+` operator performs a union on tables with compatible schemas."

    "## Requirements for Union\n",
    "\n",
    "For a union to be valid, the two operands must satisfy these conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Same Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tables must have the same primary key attributes—identical names, types, and semantic meaning. They must represent the same entity type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Valid: Both represent students with student_id as primary key\n",
    "math_majors = Student & (StudentMajor & {'dept': 'MATH'})\n",
    "physics_majors = Student & (StudentMajor & {'dept': 'PHYS'})\n",
    "stem_majors = math_majors + physics_majors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Semantic Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "All attributes shared between the two tables must be semantically compatible—they must trace to the same original definition through foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Invalid: Cannot union Student and Course—different entity types\n",
    "# Student + Course  # This would raise an error\n",
    "```"

    "## How Union Handles Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of a union includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The result's primary key is identical to that of both operands. All primary key entries from either table are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Result |\n",
    "|----------|--------|\n",
    "| Attribute in both tables | Included; value from left operand takes precedence for overlapping keys |\n",
    "| Attribute only in left table | Included; `NULL` for rows from right table |\n",
    "| Attribute only in right table | Included; `NULL` for rows from left table |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Overlapping Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "When the same primary key exists in both tables:\n",
    "- The row appears once in the result\n",
    "- Secondary attribute values come from the **left operand** (the first table in `A + B`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If student 1000 exists in both math_majors and physics_majors,\n",
    "# the secondary attributes will come from math_majors\n",
    "result = math_majors + physics_majors\n",

    "## Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Combining Query Results with OR Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Union is useful when you need entities that satisfy one condition OR another, especially when those conditions involve different related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Students who speak English OR Spanish\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n",
    "spanish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'es'})\n",
    "bilingual_candidates = english_speakers + spanish_speakers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Merging Subsets of the Same Table\n",
    "\n",
    "When you've created different filtered views of the same table, union combines them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Students from California or New York\n",
    "ca_students = Student & {'home_state': 'CA'}\n",
    "ny_students = Student & {'home_state': 'NY'}\n",
    "coastal_students = ca_students + ny_students\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For simple OR conditions on the same table, restriction with a list is often cleaner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Equivalent and more concise\n",
    "coastal_students = Student & [{'home_state': 'CA'}, {'home_state': 'NY'}]\n",
    "# Or using SQL syntax\n",
    "coastal_students = Student & 'home_state IN (\"CA\", \"NY\")'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Combining Results from Different Foreign Key Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Union shines when the OR conditions involve different relationship paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Students who either major in CS or are enrolled in a CS course\n",
    "cs_majors = Student & (StudentMajor & {'dept': 'CS'})\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Verify Entity Type Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Before unioning, confirm both operands represent the same entity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check primary keys match\n",
    "print(query_a.primary_key)\n",
    "print(query_b.primary_key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Projection for Cleaner Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Project to common attributes when operands have different secondary attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Project both to same structure\n",
    "result = query_a.proj('name') + query_b.proj('name')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Consider Alternatives for Simple Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple OR conditions, restriction with a list is cleaner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Instead of union for simple cases\n",
    "Student & 'home_state IN (\"CA\", \"NY\", \"TX\")'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Be Aware of Left Precedence\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that for overlapping primary keys, secondary attributes come from the left operand:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# order_a's attributes take precedence for shared keys\n",
    "result = order_a + order_b\n",

    "2. **Requirements**: Same primary key and entity type; semantically compatible attributes\n",
    "3. **Deduplication**: Each primary key appears once; left operand takes precedence\n",
