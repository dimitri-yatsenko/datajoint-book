    "# Operator: Join\n",
    "\n",
    "The **join operator** combines data from two tables based on their shared attributes. It produces a new table containing all attributes from both input tables, with rows matched according to DataJoint's semantic matching rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Join **combines attributes** from two tables, matching rows where shared attributes have equal values. The result contains all columns from both tables (with shared columns appearing once) and only the rows where the matching attributes align.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic matching**: Rows are matched on attributes that share both the same name and the same lineage through foreign keys\n",
    "- **Algebraic closure**: The result is a valid relation with a well-defined primary key\n",
    "- **Attribute combination**: The result contains all attributes from both tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Join two tables\n",
    "result = TableA * TableB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `*` operator performs a natural join on semantically matched attributes."

    "## Semantic Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint's join differs from SQL's `NATURAL JOIN` in an important way. Two attributes are matched only when they satisfy **both** conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They have the **same name** in both tables\n",
    "2. They trace to the **same original definition** through an uninterrupted chain of foreign keys\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents accidental joins on attributes that happen to share the same name but have different meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Semantic Matching in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider tables `Student(student_id, name)` and `Course(course_id, name)`:\n",
    "- Both have an attribute called `name`\n",
    "- But `Student.name` refers to a person's name while `Course.name` refers to a course title\n",
    "- These attributes do **not** share lineage through foreign keys\n",
    "- DataJoint will raise an error if you attempt `Student * Course` because `name` collides\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resolution**: Use projection to rename the colliding attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Rename 'name' in Course before joining\n",
    "Student * Course.proj(course_name='name')\n",

    "## Types of Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Join with Foreign Key Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common join connects tables linked by foreign keys. When table B has a foreign key referencing table A, joining them combines their attributes for each matching pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Join students with their enrollments\n",
    "# Enroll has a foreign key -> Student\n",
    "Student * Enroll\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result structure**:\n",
    "- Primary key: The union of primary keys from both tables (with shared attributes appearing once)\n",
    "- Attributes: All attributes from both tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Join without Direct Relationship (Cartesian Product)\n",
    "\n",
    "When two tables share no common attributes, the join produces a **Cartesian product**—every row from the first table paired with every row from the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# All combinations of students and departments\n",
    "Student.proj() * Department.proj()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cartesian products deliberately and with caution, as they can produce very large result sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Chained Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple tables can be joined in sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Join students with enrollments and course information\n",
    "Student * Enroll * Course\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Join is associative: `(A * B) * C` produces the same result as `A * (B * C)`."

    "\n",
    "When joining a parent table with a child table (child has foreign key to parent):\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Understand Foreign Key Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Before joining tables, understand how they're connected:\n",
    "- Check the schema diagram (`dj.Diagram(schema)`)\n",
    "- Identify which attributes will be matched\n",
    "- Predict the primary key of the result\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Restrict Before Joining\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply restrictions early to minimize intermediate result sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Better: restrict first, then join\n",
    "(Student & {'home_state': 'CA'}) * Enroll\n",
    "\n",
    "# Less efficient: join first, then restrict\n",
    "(Student * Enroll) & {'home_state': 'CA'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Resolve Name Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "If two tables have attributes with the same name but different meanings, rename them before joining:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If TableA and TableB both have 'name' with different meanings\n",
    "TableA * TableB.proj(b_name='name')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Projection to Keep Results Clean\n",
    "\n",
    "Project after joining to select only the attributes you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(Student * Enroll).proj('first_name', 'last_name', 'dept', 'course')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Be Cautious with Cartesian Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining tables with no shared attributes creates a Cartesian product. This is occasionally useful but can produce very large results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This creates 2000 students × 4 departments = 8000 rows\n",
    "Student.proj() * Department.proj()\n",

    "\n",
    "The join operator combines data from multiple tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax**: `TableA * TableB` performs a natural join on semantically matched attributes\n",
    "2. **Semantic matching**: Attributes must share both name and lineage through foreign keys\n",
