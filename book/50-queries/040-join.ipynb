    "# Operator: Join\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is an AI-generated template containing several mistakes. Work in progress)\n",
    "\n",
    "The join operator in DataJoint is a powerful tool for combining data from multiple tables. It allows users to link related data based on shared attributes, enabling seamless integration of information across a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Join Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The join operator, represented by the `*` symbol, merges two or more tables or queries into a single result set. It operates by matching rows based on their shared attributes (foreign key relationships) or combining all rows in the absence of a direct relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<Table1> * <Table2>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "1. **`Table1` and `Table2`**:\n",
    "   - The tables or queries to be joined.\n",
    "   - These must share attributes if the join is to be based on a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Joins in DataJoint\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Natural Join (Default Behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the join operator in DataJoint performs a **natural join**, combining rows from both tables where their shared attributes match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import datajoint as dj\n",
    "\n",
    "schema = dj.Schema('example_schema')\n",
    "\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Animal(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    animal_id: int  # Unique identifier for the animal\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    species: varchar(64)  # Species of the animal\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Experiment(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    experiment_id: int  # Unique experiment identifier\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    animal_id: int      # ID of the animal used in the experiment\n",
    "    description: varchar(255)\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert example data\n",
    "Animal.insert([\n",
    "    {'animal_id': 1, 'species': 'Dog'},\n",
    "    {'animal_id': 2, 'species': 'Cat'}\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment.insert([\n",
    "    {'experiment_id': 101, 'animal_id': 1, 'description': 'Behavioral test'},\n",
    "    {'experiment_id': 102, 'animal_id': 2, 'description': 'Cognitive test'}\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform a natural join\n",
    "joined_data = Animal * Experiment\n",
    "print(joined_data.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cartesian Product\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tables being joined do not share attributes, the join operator produces a **cartesian product**, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Cartesian product of unrelated tables\n",
    "unrelated_join = Animal * Experiment\n",
    "print(unrelated_join.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Combining with Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The join operator can be combined with restrictions to filter the result set further.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Join and restrict\n",
    "filtered_join = (Animal * Experiment) & {'species': 'Dog'}\n",
    "print(filtered_join.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases for Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linking Related Data**:\n",
    "   - Combine data from tables with foreign key relationships, such as linking experimental results to the animals used.\n",
    "2. **Cross-Referencing**:\n",
    "   - Perform cross-references between independent datasets.\n",
    "3. **Data Exploration**:\n",
    "   - Merge tables to explore combined attributes for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure Attribute Compatibility**:\n",
    "   - Verify that the tables being joined share appropriate attributes for natural joins.\n",
    "2. **Restrict Before Joining**:\n",
    "   - Apply restrictions before performing joins to minimize the size of intermediate results.\n",
    "3. **Use Cartesian Products Judiciously**:\n",
    "   - Avoid cartesian products unless explicitly required, as they can produce very large result sets.\n",
    "4. **Test Queries**:\n",
    "   - Test join queries incrementally to ensure correctness and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The join operator in DataJoint is a versatile tool for merging data across tables. Its ability to perform natural joins, cartesian products, and restricted joins makes it indispensable for building complex queries in relational pipelines. By mastering the join operator, users can unlock the full potential of their DataJoint schemas.\n",
