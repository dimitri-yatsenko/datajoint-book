    "# Operator: Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection operator in DataJoint is a fundamental tool for refining and transforming queries. By allowing users to select specific attributes or create derived attributes, the projection operator simplifies data retrieval and enhances the flexibility of query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Projection Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection operator, represented by the `.proj()` method, is used to create a new query that includes only the specified attributes from a table or an existing query. It can also be used to define new attributes based on transformations of existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<Table>.proj(*attributes, **renamed_attributes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "1. **`*attributes`**:\n",
    "   - A list of attributes to include in the projection.\n",
    "   - Omitting this will include all attributes by default.\n",
    "2. **`**renamed_attributes`**:\n",
    "   - Key-value pairs for renaming or creating new attributes.\n",
    "   - The key is the new attribute name, and the value is the expression or existing attribute to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting Specific Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of the projection operator is to narrow down the attributes returned by a query. This reduces the amount of data retrieved and simplifies the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import datajoint as dj\n",
    "\n",
    "schema = dj.Schema('example_schema')\n",
    "\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Animal(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    animal_id: int  # Unique identifier for the animal\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    species: varchar(64)  # Species of the animal\n",
    "    age: int             # Age of the animal in years\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert example data\n",
    "Animal.insert([\n",
    "    {'animal_id': 1, 'species': 'Dog', 'age': 5},\n",
    "    {'animal_id': 2, 'species': 'Cat', 'age': 3},\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select only the species attribute\n",
    "species_only = Animal.proj('species')\n",
    "print(species_only.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Renaming Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection can also rename attributes, allowing users to customize the output schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Rename the 'species' attribute to 'animal_species'\n",
    "renamed_query = Animal.proj(animal_species='species')\n",
    "print(renamed_query.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Derived Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection operator enables the creation of new attributes by applying transformations or calculations to existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a new attribute 'age_in_months' derived from 'age'\n",
    "projected_query = Animal.proj(age_in_months='age*12')\n",
    "print(projected_query.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Projections with Other Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Projection is often used in combination with other DataJoint operators like restriction or joins to refine queries further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Restrict and project\n",
    "restricted_projected_query = (Animal & {'species': 'Dog'}).proj('animal_id', 'age')\n",
    "print(restricted_projected_query.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimize Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - Use projection to reduce the number of attributes retrieved, especially when working with large datasets.\n",
    "2. **Rename Attributes for Clarity**:\n",
    "   - Rename attributes to make the results more readable or consistent with downstream analyses.\n",
    "3. **Use Derived Attributes**:\n",
    "   - Simplify computations by creating derived attributes directly in queries.\n",
    "4. **Combine Projections**:\n",
    "   - Combine projections with other operators like restriction or joins for more powerful queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection operator in DataJoint is a versatile tool for customizing queries. By selecting, renaming, or deriving attributes, it enables efficient and targeted data retrieval. Mastering the projection operator will enhance your ability to work effectively with complex DataJoint pipelines.\n",
