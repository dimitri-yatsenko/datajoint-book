    "## Understanding Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation answers questions like:\n",
    "- How many experiments has each animal participated in?\n",
    "- What is each student's GPA?\n",
    "- How many direct reports does each manager have?\n",
    "\n",
    "The result preserves the primary key of the grouping table while adding computed attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Grouping entity**: The table whose entities you're augmenting (e.g., Student)\n",
    "- **Aggregated entity**: The table whose data is being summarized (e.g., Grade)\n",
    "- **Algebraic closure**: The result has the same primary key as the grouping entity\n",
    "- **Left join semantics**: Entities without matches still appear (with NULL or default values)"

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Understand the Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "The grouping table determines:\n",
    "- The primary key of the result\n",
    "- Which entities appear in the output\n",
    "- The entity type represented by each row\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Meaningful Aggregate Names\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: descriptive names\n",
    "Student.aggr(Enroll, n_enrollments='COUNT(*)', total_credits='SUM(credits)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avoid: generic names\n",
    "Student.aggr(Enroll, n='COUNT(*)', x='SUM(credits)')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Restrict Before Aggregating When Possible\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# More efficient: restrict first\n",
    "(Student & {'home_state': 'CA'}).aggr(Enroll, n='COUNT(*)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Less efficient: restrict after\n",
    "Student.aggr(Enroll, n='COUNT(*)') & {'home_state': 'CA'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Handle NULL Values\n",
    "\n",
    "When the aggregated table has NULL values, use IFNULL or COALESCE:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Student.aggr(Grade, avg_grade='AVG(IFNULL(grade_value, 0))')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Test with Small Data First\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Verify the aggregation works correctly\n",
    "test_result = (Student & {'student_id': 1001}).aggr(Grade, n='COUNT(*)')\n",
