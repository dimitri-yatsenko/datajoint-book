    "# Query Operators: The Foundation of Database Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relational Algebra** is the formal mathematical foundation for database querying. It provides a systematic way to manipulate data using a small set of fundamental operations. Understanding these operators is essential for mastering database queries in both DataJoint and SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Relational Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational algebra is a **formal language** for representing and manipulating relational data. It treats data as mathematical relations (tables) and provides operations that transform these relations into new relations. This mathematical foundation ensures that database queries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precise**: Each operation has a well-defined mathematical meaning\n",
    "- **Composable**: Operations can be chained together systematically  \n",
    "- **Optimizable**: The mathematical properties enable query optimization\n",
    "- **Universal**: The same concepts apply across different database systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Query Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "From the lecture transcript, we focus on the fundamental operations that form the building blocks of all database queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Restriction** (`&` in DataJoint, `WHERE` in SQL)\n",
    "**Purpose**: Selects rows that satisfy specific conditions\n",
    "**Mathematical concept**: Filters tuples based on predicates\n",
    "**Key insight**: Restriction never changes the primary key or entity type\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL equivalent\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p.*\n",
    "FROM person p\n",
    "WHERE p.person_id IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id FROM fluency f WHERE f.lang_code = 'ENG'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Projection** (`.proj()` in DataJoint, `SELECT` in SQL)\n",
    "**Purpose**: Manipulates columns by selecting, renaming, or computing new attributes\n",
    "**Mathematical concept**: Transforms attributes while preserving entity integrity\n",
    "**Key insight**: Primary key is always preserved, enabling algebraic closure\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint\n",
    "people_with_age = Person.proj(..., age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, NOW())')\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL equivalent\n",
    "SELECT person_id, name, date_of_birth,\n",
    "       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, NOW()) AS age\n",
    "FROM person;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Join** (implicit in DataJoint, `JOIN` in SQL)\n",
    "**Purpose**: Combines related data from multiple tables\n",
    "**Mathematical concept**: Creates Cartesian products filtered by matching conditions\n",
    "**Key insight**: Foreign key relationships enable automatic joins\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint (automatic join via foreign keys)\n",
    "person_fluency = Person * Fluency\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL equivalent\n",
    "SELECT p.*, f.*\n",
    "FROM person p\n",
    "JOIN fluency f ON p.person_id = f.person_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Union** (`+` in DataJoint, `UNION` in SQL)\n",
    "**Purpose**: Combines tuples from compatible relations\n",
    "**Mathematical concept**: Set union operation\n",
    "**Key insight**: Relations must have compatible schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint\n",
    "all_speakers = english_speakers + spanish_speakers\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL equivalent\n",
    "SELECT * FROM english_speakers\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT * FROM spanish_speakers;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Aggregation** (`.aggr()` in DataJoint, `GROUP BY` in SQL)\n",
    "**Purpose**: Summarizes data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG\n",
    "**Mathematical concept**: Groups tuples and applies aggregate functions\n",
    "**Key insight**: Reduces multiple tuples to summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint\n",
    "language_counts = Fluency.aggr(language_count='COUNT(*)', group_by='lang_code')\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL equivalent\n",
    "SELECT lang_code, COUNT(*) as language_count\n",
    "FROM fluency\n",
    "GROUP BY lang_code;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algebraic Closure: The Key Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algebraic closure** is the fundamental property that makes relational algebra powerful. It means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The result of any relational operation is itself a relation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This property enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Composition of Operations**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Each step produces a relation that can be used in the next step\n",
    "step1 = Person                                    # Relation\n",
    "step2 = step1 & 'date_of_birth > \"1990-01-01\"'   # Still a relation\n",
    "step3 = step2.proj(age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(...)')     # Still a relation\n",
    "step4 = step3 & 'age > 25'                       # Still a relation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Infinite Chaining**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# You can chain operations indefinitely\n",
    "complex_query = Person & condition1 & condition2 & condition3.proj(...).aggr(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Consistent Entity Types**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# All of these are still \"Person\" relations\n",
    "original = Person\n",
    "filtered = Person & condition\n",
    "projected = Person.proj(...)\n",
    "computed = Person.proj(age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(...)')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entity Integrity: The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "From the lecture, **entity integrity** is crucial for understanding query operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Questions of Entity Integrity\n",
    "When designing queries, you must be able to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How do I prevent duplicate records?** - Ensure unique representation\n",
    "2. **How do I prevent entities sharing the same record?** - Maintain 1:1 correspondence  \n",
    "3. **How do I match entities?** - Find corresponding records\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key Preservation\n",
    "**Critical principle**: Query operators preserve entity integrity by maintaining primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Restriction preserves primary key\n",
    "people = Person                                    # Primary key: person_id\n",
    "adults = Person & 'age > 18'                      # Primary key: person_id\n",
    "\n",
    "# Projection preserves primary key  \n",
    "names = Person.proj('name')                       # Primary key: person_id\n",
    "ages = Person.proj(age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(...)')     # Primary key: person_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Order of Operations: Critical Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture emphasized that **order matters** in query construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "### DataJoint Approach (Separate Operations)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Clear separation of concerns\n",
    "people = Person & 'date_of_birth > \"1990-01-01\"'     # Restriction first\n",
    "people_with_age = people.proj(age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(...)')  # Projection second\n",
    "adults = people_with_age & 'age > 25'                 # Restriction using computed attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Approach (Combined Operations)\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- WHERE executes before SELECT internally\n",
    "SELECT name, TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, NOW()) AS age\n",
    "FROM person\n",
    "WHERE date_of_birth > '1990-01-01'    -- Can use original columns\n",
    "  AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, NOW()) > 25;  -- Must repeat calculation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistake\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# WRONG: Trying to use computed attribute before it exists\n",
    "# Person & 'age > 25'.proj(age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(...)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# CORRECT: Compute attribute first, then use it\n",
    "people_with_age = Person.proj(age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(...)')\n",
    "adults = people_with_age & 'age > 25'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with the Languages Database\n",

    "### Example: Systematic Query Building\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Restriction - Find English speakers\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Projection - Add age calculation\n",

    "    age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, NOW())'\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Restriction - Find adults\n",
    "adult_english_speakers = english_speakers_with_age & 'age >= 18'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Projection - Clean output\n",
    "result = adult_english_speakers.proj('name', 'age')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator Relationships and Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how operators work together:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Restriction + Projection**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Restrict first, then project\n",
    "filtered = Person & condition\n",
    "projected = filtered.proj(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or chain together\n",
    "result = Person & condition.proj(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "# Project first to create computed attributes, then restrict\n",
    "with_computed = Person.proj(age='TIMESTAMPDIFF(...)')\n",
    "filtered = with_computed & 'age > 25'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Join + Restriction**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Join tables, then restrict\n",
    "joined = Person * Fluency\n",
    "filtered = joined & {'lang_code': 'ENG'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Translation Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Every DataJoint operator has systematic SQL equivalents:\n",
    "\n",

    "| `Table & condition` | `SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition` |\n",
    "| `Table.proj('col')` | `SELECT primary_key, col FROM table` |\n",
