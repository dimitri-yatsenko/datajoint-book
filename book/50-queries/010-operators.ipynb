These operators form a complete query language—any question you can ask of your data can be expressed using these five tools.\n\n| Operator | Symbol | Purpose |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| **Restriction** | `&`, `-` | Filter entities by conditions |\n| **Projection** | `.proj()` | Select and compute attributes |\n| **Join** | `*` | Combine related entities |\n| **Aggregation** | `.aggr()` | Summarize related data |\n| **Union** | `+` | Combine entity sets of the same type |"

    "## Core Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the operators, two principles guide how DataJoint queries work:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entity Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Every query result is a well-formed entity set with:\n",
    "- A clear entity type (what kind of things are in the result)\n",
    "- A defined primary key (how entities are uniquely identified)\n",
    "- Attributes that directly describe each entity\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you always know what you're working with. A query on `Student` entities returns `Student` entities—not some ambiguous collection of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algebraic Closure\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of any operator is itself a valid entity set that can be used as input to another operator. This enables unlimited composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Chain operators freely\n",
    "result = ((Student & 'gpa > 3.5') * Enrollment).proj('course_name')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each intermediate step produces a valid result you can inspect, debug, or use further."

    "## Quick Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of what each operator does and when to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restriction (`&`, `-`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:** You want to filter entities based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Keep entities matching a condition\n",
    "young_mice = Mouse & 'age < 30'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Keep entities matching values from another table (semijoin)\n",
    "mice_with_sessions = Mouse & Session\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exclude entities (antijoin)\n",
    "mice_without_sessions = Mouse - Session\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Same entity type, same primary key, fewer entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projection (`.proj()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:** You want to select, rename, or compute attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Select specific attributes\n",
    "Mouse.proj('sex', 'date_of_birth')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rename an attribute  \n",
    "Mouse.proj(dob='date_of_birth')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute a new attribute\n",
    "Mouse.proj(age_days='DATEDIFF(NOW(), date_of_birth)')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Same entity type, same primary key, same number of entities, different attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Join (`*`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:** You want to combine information from related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Combine mouse info with their sessions\n",
    "Mouse * Session\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chain multiple joins\n",
    "Mouse * Session * Scan\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Combined entity type, combined primary key, only matching combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation (`.aggr()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:** You want to summarize related data for each entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Count sessions per mouse\n",
    "Mouse.aggr(Session, n_sessions='COUNT(*)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Average score per student\n",
    "Student.aggr(Grade, avg_grade='AVG(score)')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Same entity type as the first operand, enriched with summary attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Union (`+`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:** You want to combine entities from compatible tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Combine two groups of mice\n",
    "experimental_mice = Mouse & 'group=\"experimental\"'\n",
    "control_mice = Mouse & 'group=\"control\"'\n",
    "all_selected = experimental_mice + control_mice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Same entity type, combined entities (duplicates removed)."

    "## How DataJoint Differs from SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with SQL, here are the key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | SQL | DataJoint |\n",
    "|--------|-----|----------|\n",
    "| **Results** | Can produce arbitrary column sets | Always produces well-formed entity sets |\n",
    "| **Joins** | Any columns can be joined | Only semantically related attributes |\n",
    "| **Aggregation** | Transforms entity type | Enriches existing entities |\n",
    "| **Order of operations** | Hidden execution order | Explicit, left-to-right |\n",
    "| **Primary key** | Can be lost in queries | Always preserved or well-defined |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint's join operator (`*`) only matches attributes that share a semantic relationship—they must trace back to the same source through the schema's dependencies. This prevents accidental joins on coincidentally named columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint: Only joins on schema-defined relationships\n",
    "Session * Scan  # Works: scan depends on session\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL NATURAL JOIN: Joins on ANY matching column names\n",
    "# Can produce wrong results if tables share unrelated column names\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation Preserves Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL's `GROUP BY` creates a new entity type. DataJoint's `.aggr()` enriches existing entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint: Still Mouse entities, now with session counts\n",
    "Mouse.aggr(Session, n='COUNT(*)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL: Creates \"mouse summary\" entities, losing direct connection to Mouse\n",

    "# Goal: Find adult mice with more than 5 sessions, showing their average session duration\n",
