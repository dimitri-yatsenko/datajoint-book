    "# Operator: Restriction\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is an AI-generated placeholder)\n",
    "\n",
    "The restriction operator is a core feature of DataJoint, providing a powerful and expressive way to filter and query data from tables. By allowing users to specify conditions or constraints, the restriction operator simplifies retrieving subsets of data that match specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Restriction Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The restriction operator, represented by the ampersand symbol (`&`), is used to filter entries in a table based on one or more conditions. It can be applied directly to DataJoint tables or queries and works seamlessly with other DataJoint operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<Table> & <condition>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "1. **`<Table>`**: The DataJoint table or query to filter.\n",
    "2. **`<condition>`**: The filtering condition, which can be:\n",
    "   - A dictionary of attribute-value pairs.\n",
    "   - A string containing an SQL-like condition.\n",
    "   - Another DataJoint query or table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filtering with Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to use the restriction operator is with a dictionary of attribute-value pairs. This approach matches rows where the specified attributes meet the given values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import datajoint as dj\n",
    "\n",
    "schema = dj.Schema('example_schema')\n",
    "\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Animal(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    animal_id: int  # Unique identifier for the animal\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    species: varchar(64)  # Species of the animal\n",
    "    age: int             # Age of the animal in years\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert example data\n",
    "Animal.insert([\n",
    "    {'animal_id': 1, 'species': 'Dog', 'age': 5},\n",
    "    {'animal_id': 2, 'species': 'Cat', 'age': 3},\n",
    "    {'animal_id': 3, 'species': 'Rabbit', 'age': 2}\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Restrict rows where species is 'Cat'\n",
    "cats = Animal & {'species': 'Cat'}\n",
    "print(cats.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filtering with SQL-like Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify filtering conditions as strings using SQL-like syntax. This approach provides greater flexibility for more complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Restrict rows where age is greater than 3\n",
    "older_animals = Animal & 'age > 3'\n",
    "print(older_animals.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restricting with Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The restriction operator can also be used with other DataJoint queries or tables. This allows filtering based on results from related tables or upstream queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Experiment(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    experiment_id: int  # Unique experiment identifier\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    animal_id: int      # ID of the animal involved\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert example data\n",
    "Experiment.insert([\n",
    "    {'experiment_id': 1, 'animal_id': 1},\n",
    "    {'experiment_id': 2, 'animal_id': 2}\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Restrict animals involved in experiments\n",
    "experiment_animals = Animal & Experiment\n",
    "print(experiment_animals.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine multiple restrictions using the `&` operator. This is useful for applying multiple filters to refine your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Restrict rows where species is 'Dog' and age is greater than 3\n",
    "old_dogs = Animal & {'species': 'Dog'} & 'age > 3'\n",
    "print(old_dogs.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negating Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "To exclude rows matching certain conditions, you can use the negation operator (`-`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Exclude rows where species is 'Cat'\n",
    "non_cats = Animal - {'species': 'Cat'}\n",
    "print(non_cats.fetch())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Dictionaries for Simplicity**:\n",
    "   - When possible, use dictionaries for straightforward and readable queries.\n",
    "2. **Leverage SQL-like Syntax for Complex Conditions**:\n",
    "   - Use strings for more advanced filtering needs, such as range conditions or logical operators.\n",
    "3. **Combine Restrictions Thoughtfully**:\n",
    "   - Combine multiple restrictions to precisely target your data.\n",
    "4. **Test Incrementally**:\n",
    "   - Test each restriction step-by-step to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "5. **Avoid Hardcoding**:\n",
    "   - Use variables and parameters to dynamically construct restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The restriction operator is a versatile and essential tool in DataJoint. Whether you're filtering based on simple conditions, combining multiple restrictions, or leveraging related queries, the restriction operator enables precise and efficient data retrieval. Mastering its use will greatly enhance your ability to work with DataJoint pipelines.\n",
