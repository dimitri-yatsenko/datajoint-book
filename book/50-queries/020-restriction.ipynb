   "source": "# Operator: Restriction\n\nThe **restriction operator** is one of the fundamental operations in relational algebra. It selects rows from a table that satisfy specific conditions, allowing you to filter data based on criteria you define.\n\n## Understanding Restriction\n\nRestriction **selects rows** (not columns) from a table based on conditions. It's the \"WHERE clause\" equivalent in SQL, but in DataJoint it's represented by the `&` operator for inclusion and `-` operator for exclusion.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Restriction never changes the primary key** - the result still has the same entity type as the input\n- **Algebraic closure** - the result of restriction is still a valid relation that can be used in further operations\n- **Entity integrity** - restriction preserves the one-to-one correspondence between records and real-world entities\n\n### Basic Syntax\n\n```python\n# Include rows matching condition\nresult = Table & condition\n\n# Exclude rows matching condition  \nresult = Table - condition\n```\n\n## Types of Restriction Conditions\n\n### 1. Dictionary Conditions (Equality)\n\nUse dictionaries for exact equality matches:\n\n```python\n# Create example database from the lecture\nimport datajoint as dj\nschema = dj.Schema('languages_demo')\n\n@schema\nclass Person(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    person_id : int\n    ---\n    name : varchar(60)\n    date_of_birth : date\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Restrict by primary key (returns 0 or 1 record)\nperson_1 = Person & {'person_id': 1}\n\n# Restrict by secondary attributes (may return multiple records)\nmillennials = Person & {'name': 'John Doe', date_of_birth': '1990-01-01'}\n```\n\n**Key principle**: Restricting by primary key always returns at most one record because primary keys are unique.\n\n### 2. String Conditions (Inequalities and Ranges)\n\nUse strings for more complex conditions:\n\n```python\n# Range conditions\ngen_z = Person & 'date_of_birth BETWEEN \"2000-01-01\" AND \"2013-12-31\"'\n\n# Inequality conditions  \nadults = Person & 'date_of_birth < \"2005-01-01\"'\n\n# Pattern matching\nj_names = Person & 'name LIKE \"J%\"'\n```\n\n### 3. Subquery Conditions (Semijoins and Antijoins)\n\nThe most powerful form of restriction uses one query expression to restrict another. This creates **subqueries**—queries nested inside other queries. In DataJoint, subqueries emerge naturally when you use query expressions as restriction conditions, effectively creating a **semijoin** (with `&`) or **antijoin** (with `-`).\n\n```python\n@schema\nclass Language(dj.Lookup):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    lang_code : char(4)\n    ---\n    language : varchar(30)\n    \"\"\"\n    contents = [\n        ('en', 'English'),\n        ('es', 'Spanish'), \n        ('ja', 'Japanese')\n    ]\n\n@schema  \nclass Fluency(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    -> Person\n    -> Language  \n    ---\n    fluency_level : enum('beginner', 'intermediate', 'fluent')\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Find people who speak English (semijoin)\nenglish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n\n# Find people who do NOT speak English (antijoin)\nnon_english_speakers = Person - (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n```\n\nThe inner query `(Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})` acts as a subquery—its primary key values determine which rows from `Person` are included in or excluded from the result.\n\n## Systematic Query Patterns\n\nFollowing the lecture approach, let's examine systematic patterns for building complex restrictions.\n\n### Pattern 1: Existence Check (IN)\n\nFind entities that have related records in another table.\n\n```python\n# Find A where matching B exists\nresult = A & B\n```\n\n**Example: Students with Enrollments**\n\n```python\n# Find all students who are enrolled in at least one course\nenrolled_students = Student & Enroll\n```\n\n**SQL Equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM student\nWHERE student_id IN (SELECT student_id FROM enroll);\n```\n\n**Example: Students with Math Majors**\n\n```python\n# Find students majoring in math\nmath_students = Student & (StudentMajor & {'dept': 'MATH'})\n```\n\n### Pattern 2: Non-Existence Check (NOT IN)\n\nFind entities that do NOT have related records in another table.\n\n```python\n# Find A where no matching B exists\nresult = A - B\n```\n\n**Example: Students Without Enrollments**\n\n```python\n# Find students who are not enrolled in any course\nunenrolled_students = Student - Enroll\n```\n\n**SQL Equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM student\nWHERE student_id NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM enroll);\n```\n\n### Pattern 3: Multiple Conditions (AND)\n\nFind entities that satisfy multiple conditions simultaneously.\n\n```python\n# Find A where both B1 and B2 conditions are met\nresult = A & B1 & B2\n```\n\n**Example: Students Speaking Both Languages**\n\n```python\n# Find people who speak BOTH English AND Spanish\nenglish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\nspanish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'es'})\nbilingual = english_speakers & spanish_speakers\n```\n\n**SQL Equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM person\nWHERE person_id IN (\n    SELECT person_id FROM fluency WHERE lang_code = 'en'\n)\nAND person_id IN (\n    SELECT person_id FROM fluency WHERE lang_code = 'es'\n);\n```\n\n### Pattern 4: Either/Or Conditions (OR)\n\nFind entities that satisfy at least one of multiple conditions.\n\n**Using List Restriction** (for simple OR on the same attribute):\n\n```python\n# Find A where condition1 OR condition2\nresult = A & [condition1, condition2]\n```\n\n**Using Union** (for OR across different relationships):\n\n```python\n# Find A where B1 OR B2 condition is met\nresult = (A & B1) + (A & B2)\n```\n\n**Example: Students in Multiple States**\n\n```python\n# Find students from California OR New York (simple OR)\ncoastal_students = Student & [{'home_state': 'CA'}, {'home_state': 'NY'}]\n\n# Or using SQL syntax\ncoastal_students = Student & 'home_state IN (\"CA\", \"NY\")'\n```\n\n### Pattern 5: Exclusion with Condition\n\nFind entities that have some relationship but NOT a specific variant of it.\n\n```python\n# Find A where B exists but B with specific condition does not\nresult = (A & B) - (B & specific_condition)\n```\n\n**Example: Non-Fluent Speakers**\n\n```python\n# Find people who speak Japanese but are NOT fluent\njapanese_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ja'})\nfluent_japanese = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ja', 'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\nnon_fluent_japanese = japanese_speakers - fluent_japanese\n```\n\n**SQL Equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM person\nWHERE person_id IN (\n    SELECT person_id FROM fluency WHERE lang_code = 'ja'\n)\nAND person_id NOT IN (\n    SELECT person_id FROM fluency \n    WHERE lang_code = 'ja' AND fluency_level = 'fluent'\n);\n```\n\n### Pattern 6: All-or-Nothing (Universal Quantification)\n\nFind entities where ALL related records meet a condition, or where NO related records fail a condition.\n\n```python\n# Find A where ALL related B satisfy condition\n# Equivalent to: A with B, minus A with B that doesn't satisfy condition\nresult = (A & B) - (B - condition)\n```\n\n**Example: All-A Students**\n\n```python\n# Find students who have received ONLY 'A' grades (no non-A grades)\nstudents_with_grades = Student & Grade\nstudents_with_non_a = Student & (Grade - {'grade': 'A'})\nall_a_students = students_with_grades - students_with_non_a\n```\n\n**SQL Equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM student\nWHERE student_id IN (SELECT student_id FROM grade)\nAND student_id NOT IN (\n    SELECT student_id FROM grade WHERE grade <> 'A'\n);\n```\n\n### Pattern 7: Reverse Perspective\n\nSometimes you need to flip the perspective—instead of asking about entities, ask about their related entities.\n\n**Example: Languages Without Speakers**\n\n```python\n# Find languages that no one speaks\nlanguages_spoken = Language & Fluency\nunspoken_languages = Language - languages_spoken\n```\n\n**Example: Courses Without Enrollments**\n\n```python\n# Find courses with no students enrolled this term\ncourses_with_enrollment = Course & (Enroll & CurrentTerm)\nempty_courses = Course - courses_with_enrollment\n```\n\n## Self-Referencing Patterns\n\nSome tables reference themselves through foreign keys, creating hierarchies like management structures or prerequisite chains.\n\n### Management Hierarchy Example\n\nConsider a schema where employees can report to other employees:\n\n```python\n@schema\nclass Employee(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    employee_id : int\n    ---\n    name : varchar(60)\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass ReportsTo(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    -> Employee\n    ---\n    -> Employee.proj(manager_id='employee_id')\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Finding Managers\n\n```python\n# Employees who have direct reports (are managers)\nmanagers = Employee & ReportsTo.proj(employee_id='manager_id')\n```\n\n### Finding Top-Level Managers\n\n```python\n# Employees who don't report to anyone\ntop_managers = Employee - ReportsTo\n```\n\n### Finding Non-Managers\n\n```python\n# Employees with no direct reports\nnon_managers = Employee - ReportsTo.proj(employee_id='manager_id')\n```\n\n## Building Queries Systematically\n\nComplex queries are best built incrementally. Follow this approach:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Target Entity\n\nWhat type of entity do you want in your result?\n\n### Step 2: List the Conditions\n\nWhat criteria must the entities satisfy?\n\n### Step 3: Build Each Condition as a Query\n\nCreate separate query expressions for each condition.\n\n### Step 4: Combine with Appropriate Operators\n\n- Use `&` for AND conditions\n- Use `-` for NOT conditions\n- Use `+` for OR conditions across different paths\n\n### Step 5: Test Incrementally\n\nVerify each intermediate result.\n\n### Example: Building a Complex Query\n\n**Goal**: Find CS majors who are enrolled this term but haven't received any grades yet.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Target entity is Student\n# Step 2: Conditions:\n#   - Has CS major\n#   - Enrolled in current term\n#   - No grades in current term\n\n# Step 3: Build each condition\ncs_majors = Student & (StudentMajor & {'dept': 'CS'})\nenrolled_current = Student & (Enroll & CurrentTerm)\ngraded_current = Student & (Grade & CurrentTerm)\n\n# Step 4: Combine\nresult = cs_majors & enrolled_current - graded_current\n\n# Step 5: Verify counts\nprint(f\"CS majors: {len(cs_majors)}\")\nprint(f\"Enrolled current term: {len(enrolled_current)}\")\nprint(f\"CS majors enrolled, no grades: {len(result)}\")\n```\n\n## Summary of Patterns\n\n| Pattern | DataJoint | SQL Equivalent |\n|---------|-----------|----------------|\n| Existence (IN) | `A & B` | `WHERE id IN (SELECT ...)` |\n| Non-existence (NOT IN) | `A - B` | `WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT ...)` |\n| AND (both conditions) | `A & B1 & B2` | `WHERE ... AND ...` |\n| OR (either condition) | `(A & B1) + (A & B2)` | `WHERE ... OR ...` |\n| Exclusion | `(A & B) - B_condition` | `WHERE IN (...) AND NOT IN (...)` |\n| Universal (all match) | `(A & B) - (B - condition)` | `WHERE IN (...) AND NOT IN (NOT condition)` |\n\nKey principles:\n1. **Build incrementally** — construct complex queries from simpler parts\n2. **Test intermediate results** — verify each step before combining\n3. **Think in sets** — restriction filters sets, not individual records\n4. **Primary key is preserved** — restrictions never change the entity type\n\n## Understanding Query Execution\n\n### Order of Operations\n\nUnlike SQL where SELECT and WHERE are in one statement, DataJoint separates concerns:\n\n1. **DataJoint approach**: \n   ```python\n   result = Person & condition  # Restriction first\n   result = result.proj(...)    # Projection second\n   ```\n\n2. **SQL approach**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT columns    -- Projection  \n   FROM table       \n   WHERE condition  -- Restriction (executed first internally)\n   ```\n\n### Primary Key Preservation\n\n**Critical concept**: Restriction never changes the primary key or entity type.\n\n```python\n# All of these have the same primary key: person_id\npeople = Person                    # Primary key: person_id\nenglish_speakers = Person & (...)  # Primary key: person_id  \ngen_z = Person & (...)            # Primary key: person_id\n```\n\nThis enables **algebraic closure** - you can chain restrictions infinitely:\n\n```python\nresult = Person & condition1 & condition2 & condition3  # Still a Person table\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Think in Sets and Logic\n\nWhen designing restrictions, think about:\n- What set am I starting with?\n- What subset do I want?\n- How do I express that mathematically?\n\n### 2. Build Complex Queries Incrementally\n\n```python\n# Start simple\nenglish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\nprint(f\"English speakers: {len(english_speakers)}\")\n\n# Add complexity  \nfluent_english = english_speakers & (Fluency & {'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\nprint(f\"Fluent English speakers: {len(fluent_english)}\")\n\n# Add more conditions\ngen_z_fluent_english = fluent_english & 'date_of_birth > \"2000-01-01\"'\n```\n\n### 3. Understand Foreign Key Relationships\n\nSubqueries work because of foreign key relationships:\n\n```python\n# This works because Fluency.person_id references Person.person_id\nenglish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n```\n\nThe restriction automatically matches on the shared attributes (foreign key relationships).\n\n### 4. Test Your Logic\n\nFor complex queries, verify your logic:\n\n```python\n# Test: People who speak both English and Spanish\nenglish = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\nspanish = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'SPA'})\nboth = english & spanish\n\n# Verify: Should be subset of both individual sets\nassert len(both) <= len(english)\nassert len(both) <= len(spanish)\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe restriction operator is fundamental to database querying. Key takeaways:\n\n1. **Restriction selects rows** based on conditions\n2. **Primary key is preserved** - algebraic closure is maintained  \n3. **Three condition types**: dictionaries (equality), strings (inequalities), subqueries (relationships)\n4. **Build systematically**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally\n5. **Think in sets**: Use mathematical logic to design queries\n6. **Foreign keys enable subqueries**: Relationships between tables drive complex restrictions\n\nMaster these patterns and you can answer any query that asks \"find records where...\""
