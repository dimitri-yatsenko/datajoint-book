    "# Operator: Restriction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **restriction operator** is one of the fundamental operations in relational algebra. It selects rows from a table that satisfy specific conditions, allowing you to filter data based on criteria you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Restriction\n",
    "\n",
    "Restriction **selects rows** (not columns) from a table based on conditions. It's the \"WHERE clause\" equivalent in SQL, but in DataJoint it's represented by the `&` operator for inclusion and `-` operator for exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Restriction never changes the primary key** - the result still has the same entity type as the input\n",
    "- **Algebraic closure** - the result of restriction is still a valid relation that can be used in further operations\n",
    "- **Entity integrity** - restriction preserves the one-to-one correspondence between records and real-world entities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Include rows matching condition\n",
    "result = Table & condition\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exclude rows matching condition  \n",
    "result = Table - condition\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Restriction Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dictionary Conditions (Equality)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use dictionaries for exact equality matches:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create example database from the lecture\n",
    "import datajoint as dj\n",
    "schema = dj.Schema('languages_demo')\n",
    "\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Person(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    person_id : int\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    name : varchar(60)\n",
    "    date_of_birth : date\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Restrict by primary key (returns 0 or 1 record)\n",
    "person_1 = Person & {'person_id': 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Restrict by secondary attributes (may return multiple records)\n",
    "millennials = Person & {'name': 'John Doe', date_of_birth': '1990-01-01'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key principle**: Restricting by primary key always returns at most one record because primary keys are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. String Conditions (Inequalities and Ranges)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use strings for more complex conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Range conditions\n",
    "gen_z = Person & 'date_of_birth BETWEEN \"2000-01-01\" AND \"2013-12-31\"'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inequality conditions  \n",
    "adults = Person & 'date_of_birth < \"2005-01-01\"'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pattern matching\n",
    "j_names = Person & 'name LIKE \"J%\"'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Subquery Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The most powerful form - restrict one table based on another:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Language(dj.Lookup):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    lang_code : char(4)\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    language : varchar(30)\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    contents = [\n",
    "        ('en', 'English'),\n",
    "        ('es', 'Spanish'), \n",
    "        ('ja', 'Japanese')\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "\n",
    "@schema  \n",
    "class Fluency(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    -> Person\n",
    "    -> Language  \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    fluency_level : enum('beginner', 'intermediate', 'fluent')\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find people who speak English\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systematic Query Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the lecture approach, let's examine systematic patterns for building complex restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 1: Basic Subquery (IN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Find all people who speak English\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Equivalent**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p.*\n",
    "FROM person p  \n",
    "WHERE p.person_id IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id\n",
    "    FROM fluency f\n",
    "    WHERE f.lang_code = 'en'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**: This selects people whose `person_id` appears in the fluency table with English.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 2: Negated Subquery (NOT IN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Find people who do NOT speak English\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "non_english_speakers = Person - (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Equivalent**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p.*\n",
    "FROM person p\n",
    "WHERE p.person_id NOT IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id  \n",
    "    FROM fluency f\n",
    "    WHERE f.lang_code = 'en'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 3: Multiple Conditions (AND)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Find people who speak BOTH English AND Spanish\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n",
    "spanish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'es'})\n",
    "bilingual = english_speakers & spanish_speakers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Equivalent**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p.*\n",
    "FROM person p\n",
    "WHERE p.person_id IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id FROM fluency f WHERE f.lang_code = 'en'\n",
    ")\n",
    "AND p.person_id IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id FROM fluency f WHERE f.lang_code = 'es'  \n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: When you need \"both conditions\", use separate subqueries connected with AND.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 4: Multiple Conditions (OR)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Find people who speak English OR Spanish\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Method 1: Using DataJoint\n",
    "english_or_spanish = Person & (Fluency & 'lang_code IN (\"en\", \"es\")')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 2: More explicit\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n",
    "spanish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'es'}) \n",
    "either_language = english_speakers.proj() + spanish_speakers.proj()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Equivalent**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p.*\n",
    "FROM person p\n",
    "WHERE p.person_id IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id\n",
    "    FROM fluency f  \n",
    "    WHERE f.lang_code IN ('en', 'es')\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 5: Complex Negation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Find people who speak Japanese but NOT fluently\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "japanese_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ja'})\n",
    "fluent_japanese = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ja', 'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\n",
    "japanese_non_fluent = japanese_speakers - fluent_japanese\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Equivalent**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p.*\n",
    "FROM person p\n",
    "WHERE p.person_id IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id FROM fluency f WHERE f.lang_code = 'ja'\n",
    ")\n",
    "AND p.person_id NOT IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id FROM fluency f \n",
    "    WHERE f.lang_code = 'ja' AND f.fluency_level = 'fluent'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Examples from the Lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Languages Without Fluent Speakers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Find languages that no one speaks fluently\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fluent_speakers = Fluency & {'fluency_level': 'fluent'}\n",
    "languages_with_fluent_speakers = Language & fluent_speakers\n",
    "languages_without_fluent_speakers = Language - languages_with_fluent_speakers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Equivalent**:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT l.*\n",
    "FROM language l\n",
    "WHERE l.lang_code NOT IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.lang_code\n",
    "    FROM fluency f\n",
    "    WHERE f.fluency_level = 'fluent'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Generational Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define generations by birth year ranges\n",
    "gen_z = Person & 'date_of_birth BETWEEN \"2000-01-01\" AND \"2013-12-31\"'\n",
    "millennials = Person & 'date_of_birth BETWEEN \"1981-01-01\" AND \"1999-12-31\"'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find Gen Z English speakers\n",
    "gen_z_english = gen_z & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Query Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike SQL where SELECT and WHERE are in one statement, DataJoint separates concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DataJoint approach**: \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = Person & condition  # Restriction first\n",
    "   result = result.proj(...)    # Projection second\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SQL approach**:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT columns    -- Projection  \n",
    "   FROM table       \n",
    "   WHERE condition  -- Restriction (executed first internally)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key Preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical concept**: Restriction never changes the primary key or entity type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# All of these have the same primary key: person_id\n",
    "people = Person                    # Primary key: person_id\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (...)  # Primary key: person_id  \n",
    "gen_z = Person & (...)            # Primary key: person_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables **algebraic closure** - you can chain restrictions infinitely:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = Person & condition1 & condition2 & condition3  # Still a Person table\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices from the Lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Think in Sets and Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing restrictions, think about:\n",
    "- What set am I starting with?\n",
    "- What subset do I want?\n",
    "- How do I express that mathematically?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Build Complex Queries Incrementally\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start simple\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n",
    "print(f\"English speakers: {len(english_speakers)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add complexity  \n",
    "fluent_english = english_speakers & (Fluency & {'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\n",
    "print(f\"Fluent English speakers: {len(fluent_english)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add more conditions\n",
    "gen_z_fluent_english = fluent_english & 'date_of_birth > \"2000-01-01\"'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Understand Foreign Key Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Subqueries work because of foreign key relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This works because Fluency.person_id references Person.person_id\n",
    "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The restriction automatically matches on the shared attributes (foreign key relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Test Your Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex queries, verify your logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test: People who speak both English and Spanish\n",
    "english = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n",
    "spanish = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'SPA'})\n",
    "both = english & spanish\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify: Should be subset of both individual sets\n",
    "assert len(both) <= len(english)\n",
    "assert len(both) <= len(spanish)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Translation Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Every DataJoint restriction follows predictable SQL patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Restriction\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint\n",
    "Person & {'person_id': 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL  \n",
    "SELECT * FROM person WHERE person_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Restriction\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint\n",
    "Person & 'age > 25'\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 25;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subquery Restriction\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DataJoint\n",
    "Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT p.* \n",
    "FROM person p\n",
    "WHERE p.person_id IN (\n",
    "    SELECT f.person_id \n",
    "    FROM fluency f \n",
    "    WHERE f.lang_code = 'ENG'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The restriction operator is fundamental to database querying. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Restriction selects rows** based on conditions\n",
    "2. **Primary key is preserved** - algebraic closure is maintained  \n",
    "3. **Three condition types**: dictionaries (equality), strings (inequalities), subqueries (relationships)\n",
    "4. **Build systematically**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally\n",
    "5. **Think in sets**: Use mathematical logic to design queries\n",
    "6. **Foreign keys enable subqueries**: Relationships between tables drive complex restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Master these patterns and you can answer any query that asks \"find records where...\"\n",

These exercises will help you develop systematic thinking about restriction queries.\n\n### Setup: Languages Database\n\n```python\nimport datajoint as dj\nschema = dj.Schema('languages_practice')\n\n@schema\nclass Language(dj.Lookup):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    lang_code : char(4)\n    ---\n    language : varchar(30)\n    \"\"\"\n    contents = [\n        ('ENG', 'English'),\n        ('SPA', 'Spanish'),\n        ('JPN', 'Japanese'),\n        ('TAG', 'Tagalog'),\n        ('MAN', 'Mandarin'),\n        ('POR', 'Portuguese')\n    ]\n\n@schema\nclass Person(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    person_id : int\n    ---\n    name : varchar(60)\n    date_of_birth : date\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass Fluency(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    -> Person\n    -> Language\n    ---\n    fluency_level : enum('beginner', 'intermediate', 'fluent')\n    \"\"\"\n\n# Populate with sample data...\n```\n\n### Exercise 1: Basic Restrictions\n\n**Question**: How would you find person with ID 5?\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\nperson_5 = Person & {'person_id': 5}\n```\n\n**Key insight**: Primary key restrictions return 0 or 1 record.\n\n**Question**: How would you find all people born after 2000?\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ngen_z = Person & 'date_of_birth > \"2000-01-01\"'\n```\n\n### Exercise 2: Simple Subqueries\n\n**Question**: Find all people who speak English.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking**:\n1. I want people (start with `Person` table)\n2. Who speak English (condition in `Fluency` table)\n3. English speakers are those whose `person_id` appears in `Fluency` with `lang_code = 'ENG'`\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\nenglish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n```\n\n**SQL equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT p.*\nFROM person p\nWHERE p.person_id IN (\n    SELECT f.person_id\n    FROM fluency f\n    WHERE f.lang_code = 'ENG'\n);\n```\n\n### Exercise 3: Negation\n\n**Question**: Find people who do NOT speak English.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking**:\n1. I want people (start with `Person` table)\n2. Who do NOT speak English (exclude those in the English speakers set)\n3. Use subtraction operator `-`\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\nnon_english_speakers = Person - (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\n```\n\n**SQL equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT p.*\nFROM person p\nWHERE p.person_id NOT IN (\n    SELECT f.person_id\n    FROM fluency f\n    WHERE f.lang_code = 'ENG'\n);\n```\n\n### Exercise 4: Multiple Conditions (AND)\n\n**Question**: Find people who speak BOTH English AND Spanish.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking**:\n1. I want people who speak English AND Spanish\n2. This means they must be in BOTH sets\n3. Create each set separately, then intersect with `&`\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\nenglish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\nspanish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'SPA'})\nbilingual = english_speakers & spanish_speakers\n```\n\n**SQL equivalent**:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT p.*\nFROM person p\nWHERE p.person_id IN (\n    SELECT f.person_id FROM fluency f WHERE f.lang_code = 'ENG'\n)\nAND p.person_id IN (\n    SELECT f.person_id FROM fluency f WHERE f.lang_code = 'SPA'\n);\n```\n\n### Exercise 5: Multiple Conditions (OR)\n\n**Question**: Find people who speak English OR Spanish.\n\n**Solution Method 1** (using IN):\n```python\nenglish_or_spanish = Person & (Fluency & 'lang_code IN (\"ENG\", \"SPA\")')\n```\n\n**Solution Method 2** (explicit union):\n```python\nenglish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\nspanish_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'SPA'})\n# Note: Union removes duplicates automatically\n```\n\n### Exercise 6: Complex Negation\n\n**Question**: Find people who speak Japanese but NOT fluently.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking**:\n1. I want Japanese speakers (those in Fluency with Japanese)\n2. But NOT fluent ones (exclude those with fluency_level = 'fluent')\n3. Japanese speakers MINUS fluent Japanese speakers\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\njapanese_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'JPN'})\nfluent_japanese = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'JPN', 'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\njapanese_non_fluent = japanese_speakers - fluent_japanese\n```\n\n**Alternative solution** (direct):\n```python\njapanese_non_fluent = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'JPN'}) - \\\n                     (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'JPN', 'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\n```\n\n### Exercise 7: Reverse Perspective\n\n**Question**: Find languages that are NOT spoken by anyone fluently.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking**:\n1. I want languages (start with `Language` table)\n2. That are NOT spoken fluently (exclude those that appear in fluent records)\n3. Languages MINUS languages with fluent speakers\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\nfluent_records = Fluency & {'fluency_level': 'fluent'}\nlanguages_with_fluent_speakers = Language & fluent_records\nlanguages_without_fluent_speakers = Language - languages_with_fluent_speakers\n```\n\n### Exercise 8: Chaining Restrictions\n\n**Question**: Find Gen Z people who speak English fluently.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking**:\n1. Start with all people\n2. Restrict to Gen Z (born after 2000)\n3. Further restrict to English speakers\n4. Further restrict to fluent level\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ngen_z = Person & 'date_of_birth > \"2000-01-01\"'\ngen_z_english = gen_z & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\ngen_z_english_fluent = gen_z_english & (Fluency & {'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\n\n# Or in one line:\nresult = Person & 'date_of_birth > \"2000-01-01\"' & \\\n         (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG', 'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\n```\n\n## Debugging and Verification Techniques\n\n### Test Your Logic\n\n```python\n# Always verify your logic makes sense\nenglish = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\nspanish = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'SPA'})\nboth = english & spanish\n\n# Sanity checks:\nprint(f\"English speakers: {len(english)}\")\nprint(f\"Spanish speakers: {len(spanish)}\")\nprint(f\"Bilingual: {len(both)}\")\n\n# Both should be <= each individual set\nassert len(both) <= len(english)\nassert len(both) <= len(spanish)\n```\n\n### Build Incrementally\n\n```python\n# Start simple and add complexity\nstep1 = Person\nprint(f\"All people: {len(step1)}\")\n\nstep2 = step1 & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'ENG'})\nprint(f\"English speakers: {len(step2)}\")\n\nstep3 = step2 & (Fluency & {'fluency_level': 'fluent'})\nprint(f\"Fluent English speakers: {len(step3)}\")\n```\n\n### Common Patterns Summary\n\n1. **Basic inclusion**: `Table & condition`\n2. **Basic exclusion**: `Table - condition`\n3. **Logicial Donjunction (AND-list)**: `Table & cond1 & cond2 & cond3`\n4. **Logical Disjunction (OR-list)**: `Table & [cond1, cond2, cond3]`\n\nThese patterns form the building blocks for any restriction query you'll encounter.\n\n## Further Practice\n\n:::{seealso}\nFor comprehensive query examples covering restriction and all other operators on a realistic academic database, see the [University Queries](../80-examples/016-university-queries.ipynb) example, which demonstrates these patterns with 2,000 students, multiple departments, course enrollments, and grade tracking.\n:::"
