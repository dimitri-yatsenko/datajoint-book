    "# Subqueries and Query Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subqueries** are queries nested inside other queries. In DataJoint, subqueries emerge naturally when you use query expressions as restriction conditions. This chapter explores common patterns for answering complex questions using composed queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Subqueries in DataJoint\n",
    "\n",
    "In DataJoint, you create subqueries by using one query expression to restrict another. The restriction operator (`&` or `-`) accepts query expressions as conditions, effectively creating a semijoin or antijoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Outer query restricted by inner query (subquery)\n",
    "result = OuterTable & InnerQuery\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `InnerQuery` acts as a subquery—its primary key values determine which rows from `OuterTable` are included in the result."
