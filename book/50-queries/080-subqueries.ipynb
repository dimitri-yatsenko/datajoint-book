        "# Subqueries and Complex Query Patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "Subqueries are one of the most powerful features in database querying, allowing you to build complex queries by nesting one query inside another. This chapter explores various subquery patterns and their applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Understanding Subqueries\n",
        "\n",
        "A **subquery** is a query nested inside another query. The outer query uses the results of the inner query to filter, join, or otherwise process data. Subqueries are essential for answering complex questions that require information from multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Subqueries\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Scalar subqueries**: Return a single value\n",
        "2. **Row subqueries**: Return a single row with multiple columns\n",
        "3. **Table subqueries**: Return multiple rows (used with IN, EXISTS, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Basic Subquery Patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pattern 1: Filtering with IN\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common subquery pattern uses `IN` to filter one table based on values from another:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Find all people who speak English\n",
        "english_speakers = Person & (Fluency & {'lang_code': 'en'})\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQL Equivalent:**\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT *\n",
        "FROM person\n",
        "WHERE person_id IN (\n",

        "    WHERE lang_code = 'en'\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pattern 2: Filtering with NOT IN\n",
        "\n",
        "Use `NOT IN` to exclude records that match the subquery:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
