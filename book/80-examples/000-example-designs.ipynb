   "source": "## Overview of Examples\n\nThis section presents a variety of schema examples that demonstrate different aspects of DataJoint design principles. Each example showcases specific patterns, relationships, and use cases ranging from classic database tutorials to real-world scientific applications.\n\n### Classic Database Examples\n\nThese examples are adapted from well-known database tutorials to show how traditional relational designs map to DataJoint's entity-workflow model.\n\n#### [Classic Sales Database](010-classic-sales.ipynb)\nThe classic MySQL tutorial sales database featuring customers, orders, products, and employees. This example demonstrates:\n- Traditional business database design\n- Many-to-many relationships through order details\n- Employee management hierarchies\n- Product lines and order fulfillment\n\n#### [University Database](015-university.ipynb)\nA university course enrollment system with students, courses, instructors, and enrollments. This example illustrates:\n- Academic record keeping\n- Course registration workflows\n- Student-course many-to-many relationships\n- Grade tracking and prerequisites\n\n#### [Nations Database](030-nations.ipynb)\nA geographical database with countries, regions, and continents from the MariaDB tutorial. This example shows:\n- Hierarchical geographical relationships\n- Lookup tables for standardized data\n- Regional groupings and classifications\n\n### Conceptual Examples\n\nThese examples focus on specific design patterns and conceptual challenges in database modeling.\n\n#### [Hotel Reservation System](040-hotel.ipynb)\nA complete hotel management system with rooms, reservations, check-ins, and check-outs. This design exercise demonstrates:\n- Time-series data (room availability and pricing)\n- Business rule enforcement (no double-booking, check-in requires reservation)\n- Guest management and payment processing\n- Temporal queries (who stayed when, room history)\n\n#### [Social Generations](044-generations.ipynb)\nDefines social generations as birth cohorts sharing cultural and historical experiences. This example explores:\n- Lookup tables for reference data\n- Birth year ranges and generational characteristics\n- Cultural archetypes and life principles\n- Using DataJoint to model sociological concepts\n\n#### [Languages and Proficiency](050-languages.ipynb)\nA many-to-many relationship design tracking people and their language skills using international standards. This comprehensive example demonstrates:\n- **ISO 639-1 language codes**: Standardized two-letter codes for major world languages\n- **CEFR proficiency levels**: Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (A1-C2)\n- **Association tables**: `Proficiency` as a workflow step linking people, languages, and levels\n- **Lookup tables**: Both `Language` and `CEFRLevel` with predefined, standardized content\n- **International standards**: Using established frameworks ensures consistency and compatibility\n- **Sample queries**: Finding multilingual individuals, proficient speakers, and language statistics\n\n### Organizational Examples\n\nThese examples model organizational structures and hierarchies.\n\n#### [Management Hierarchy](060-management.ipynb)\nDemonstrates self-referencing tables and organizational relationships. This example shows:\n- Employees managing other employees (recursive relationships)\n- Department structure with chairs and budgets\n- Organizational hierarchies and reporting chains\n- One-to-one relationships (department chairs)\n- Normalized department data (codes, names, budgets, locations)\n\n### Scientific Examples\n\nReal-world scientific applications demonstrating DataJoint in research contexts.\n\n#### [Allen Common Coordinate Framework](065-allen-ccf.ipynb)\nThe Allen Brain Atlas coordinate system for mouse brain anatomy. This example illustrates:\n- 3D spatial coordinates and brain structure atlases\n- Hierarchical anatomical relationships\n- Integration with neuroimaging data\n- Real scientific data pipeline from the DataJoint Elements project\n- Published standards in neuroscience research\n\n#### [Julia Fractals](070-fractals.ipynb)\nComputational visualization of Julia sets from fractal mathematics. This example demonstrates:\n- Computed tables for mathematical functions\n- Parameter spaces and computational workflows\n- Image generation and visualization\n- Using DataJoint for reproducible computational art\n- Automatic computation with `populate()`\n\n#### [Blob Detection Pipeline](075-blob-detection.ipynb)\nAn image analysis pipeline that detects bright blobs in images. This example demonstrates:\n- Master-part table relationships for computational workflows\n- Lookup tables for algorithm parameters\n- Computed tables with automatic population\n- Visualization of detection results\n- Atomic transactions for workflow integrity\n\n---\n\nEach example is self-contained with:\n- Complete schema definitions\n- Sample data population\n- Example queries demonstrating key concepts\n- Visual diagrams showing table relationships\n- Code that you can run and modify\n\nBrowse through these examples to see different design patterns in action and learn how to apply DataJoint principles to your own domains."
