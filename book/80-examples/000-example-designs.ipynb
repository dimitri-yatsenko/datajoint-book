    "## Overview of Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents a variety of schema examples that demonstrate different aspects of DataJoint design principles. Each example showcases specific patterns, relationships, and use cases ranging from classic database tutorials to real-world scientific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic Database Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples are adapted from well-known database tutorials to show how traditional relational designs map to DataJoint's entity-workflow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Classic Sales Database](010-classic-sales.ipynb)\n",
    "The classic MySQL tutorial sales database featuring customers, orders, products, and employees. This example demonstrates:\n",
    "- Traditional business database design\n",
    "- Many-to-many relationships through order details\n",
    "- Employee management hierarchies\n",
    "- Product lines and order fulfillment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [University Database](015-university.ipynb)\n",
    "A university course enrollment system with students, courses, instructors, and enrollments. This example illustrates:\n",
    "- Academic record keeping\n",
    "- Course registration workflows\n",
    "- Student-course many-to-many relationships\n",
    "- Grade tracking and prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Nations Database](030-nations.ipynb)\n",
    "A geographical database with countries, regions, and continents from the MariaDB tutorial. This example shows:\n",
    "- Hierarchical geographical relationships\n",
    "- Lookup tables for standardized data\n",
    "- Regional groupings and classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples focus on specific design patterns and conceptual challenges in database modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Hotel Reservation System](040-hotel.ipynb)\n",
    "A complete hotel management system with rooms, reservations, check-ins, and check-outs. This design exercise demonstrates:\n",
    "- Time-series data (room availability and pricing)\n",
    "- Business rule enforcement (no double-booking, check-in requires reservation)\n",
    "- Guest management and payment processing\n",
    "- Temporal queries (who stayed when, room history)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Social Generations](044-generations.ipynb)\n",
    "Defines social generations as birth cohorts sharing cultural and historical experiences. This example explores:\n",
    "- Lookup tables for reference data\n",
    "- Birth year ranges and generational characteristics\n",
    "- Cultural archetypes and life principles\n",
    "- Using DataJoint to model sociological concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Languages and Proficiency](050-languages.ipynb)\n",
    "A many-to-many relationship design tracking people and their language skills using international standards. This comprehensive example demonstrates:\n",
    "- **ISO 639-1 language codes**: Standardized two-letter codes for major world languages\n",
    "- **CEFR proficiency levels**: Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (A1-C2)\n",
    "- **Association tables**: `Proficiency` as a workflow step linking people, languages, and levels\n",
    "- **Lookup tables**: Both `Language` and `CEFRLevel` with predefined, standardized content\n",
    "- **International standards**: Using established frameworks ensures consistency and compatibility\n",
    "- **Sample queries**: Finding multilingual individuals, proficient speakers, and language statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organizational Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples model organizational structures and hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Management Hierarchy](060-management.ipynb)\n",
    "Demonstrates self-referencing tables and organizational relationships. This example shows:\n",
    "- Employees managing other employees (recursive relationships)\n",
    "- Department structure with chairs and budgets\n",
    "- Organizational hierarchies and reporting chains\n",
    "- One-to-one relationships (department chairs)\n",
    "- Normalized department data (codes, names, budgets, locations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world scientific applications demonstrating DataJoint in research contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Allen Common Coordinate Framework](065-allen-ccf.ipynb)\n",
    "The Allen Brain Atlas coordinate system for mouse brain anatomy. This example illustrates:\n",
    "- 3D spatial coordinates and brain structure atlases\n",
    "- Hierarchical anatomical relationships\n",
    "- Integration with neuroimaging data\n",
    "- Real scientific data pipeline from the DataJoint Elements project\n",
    "- Published standards in neuroscience research\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Julia Sets](070-julia.ipynb)\n",
    "Computational visualization of Julia sets from fractal mathematics. This example demonstrates:\n",
    "- Computed tables for mathematical functions\n",
    "- Parameter spaces and computational workflows\n",
    "- Image generation and visualization\n",
    "- Using DataJoint for reproducible computational art\n",
    "- Automatic computation with `populate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example is self-contained with:\n",
    "- Complete schema definitions\n",
    "- Sample data population\n",
    "- Example queries demonstrating key concepts\n",
    "- Visual diagrams showing table relationships\n",
    "- Code that you can run and modify\n",
    "\n",
    "Browse through these examples to see different design patterns in action and learn how to apply DataJoint principles to your own domains.\n"
