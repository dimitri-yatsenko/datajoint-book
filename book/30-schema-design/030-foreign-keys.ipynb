    "While **entity integrity** ensures that each record uniquely represents a real-world entity, **referential integrity** ensures that the *relationships between* these entities are valid and consistent. It's a guarantee that you won't have an employee assigned to a non-existent department or a task associated with a deleted project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, **referential integrity is impossible without entity integrity**. You must first have a reliable way to identify unique entities before you can define their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In relational databases, these relationships are established and enforced using **foreign keys**. A foreign key creates a link between a **child table** (the one with the reference) and a **parent table** (the one being referenced). Think of `Employee` as the child and `Title` as the parent; an employee must have a valid, existing title.\n",

    "A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in the child table that refers to the primary key of the parent table. In DataJoint, a foreign key *always* references a parent's primary key, which is a highly recommended practice for clarity and consistency.\n",
