    "## Uniqueness Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness constraints are typically set through primary keys, but tables can also have additional unique indexes beyond the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Referential Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential constraints establish relationships between tables and are enforced by [foreign keys](030-foreign-keys.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreign Keys Establish 1:N or 1:1 Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "When a child table defines a foreign key constraint to a parent table, it creates a relationship between the entities in the parent and child tables. The cardinality of this relationship is always **1 on the parent side**: each entry in the child table must refer to a single entity in the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the child side, the relationship can have different cardinalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **0–1**: if the foreign key field in the child table has a unique constraint.\n",
    "- **N**: if no uniqueness constraint is applied to the foreign key field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s illustrate these possibilities with examples of bank customers and their accounts.\n"

    "The diagramming notation represents this relationship with a thick solid line, which indicates the strongest type of dependency between two entities.\n",

    "This setup creates a strict one-to-one relationship between Customer5 and Account5, where each account is uniquely and exclusively linked to a single customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of This Structure\n",
    "* **Unified Identity:** Since `Account5` shares the primary key with `Customer5`, each `Account5` record is uniquely identified by the same key as `Customer5`.\n",
    "This enforces the rule that each account cannot exist without an associated customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conflated Entities:** In the diagram, the name `Account5` is no longer underscored, indicating it has ceased to function as a separate “dimension” or independent entity. `Account5` is now fully conflated with `Customer5`, meaning it effectively serves as an extension of the `Customer5` entity, rather than an independent table with its own identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Keep Separate Tables?\n",
    "Although this design could allow us to simply merge all account-related data into the `Customer5` table, there are reasons we may choose to keep `Account5` as a separate table:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity and Clarity**: Separating `Account5` from `Customer5` keeps the structure modular, which can clarify different aspects of customer and account data in queries and during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Management**: By keeping account information in a separate table, we can manage and update account-related data independently from customer information. This separation can be beneficial for tasks such as auditing, logging, or updating fields associated with only account data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Optional Fields**: In cases where certain fields are only relevant to accounts (e.g., open_date, account-specific details), keeping them in a separate table prevents having unused or irrelevant fields in the main `Customer5` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access Control**: When account information is sensitive or needs restricted access, placing it in a separate table can simplify access control, allowing finer-grained security policies around account data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability and Maintenance**: Over time, this separation can support scalability as customer and account data expand. If we anticipate adding extensive account-specific data or if account records will be managed differently from customer records, the separate tables facilitate maintenance and future-proof the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Schema Evolution**: Separate tables provide flexibility to adapt or expand either the Customer5 or Account5 table independently, without altering the other table. This flexibility is especially useful if the schema is expected to evolve over time."
