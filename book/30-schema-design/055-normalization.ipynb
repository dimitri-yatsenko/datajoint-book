        "1. **Foreign keys reference complete tuples**: When a table references another via foreign key, it references the entire entity, not just individual attributes. Updates can break these relationships in subtle ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Workflows and data dependencies**: In computational pipelines, downstream data is derived from upstream data. Updating upstream data invalidates downstream results, but foreign key constraints won't detect this. Deletion forces you to explicitly address dependencies.\n",

        "3. **History and audit trails**: Immutable records naturally preserve history. Changes are represented as new records, not modifications to existing ones.\n",
