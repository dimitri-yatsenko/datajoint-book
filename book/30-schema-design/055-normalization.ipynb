        "\n",
        "1. **Foreign keys reference complete workflow artifacts**: When a table references another via foreign key, it references the entire workflow entity created at a specific step. Updates can break these workflow relationships in subtle ways.\n",
        "\n",

Updating upstream entities invalidates downstream workflow artifacts, but foreign key constraints won't detect this. Deletion forces you to explicitly address workflow dependencies.\n",
