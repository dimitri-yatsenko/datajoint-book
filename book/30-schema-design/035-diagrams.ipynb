   "source": "# Understanding Line Styles\n\nThe most important feature of DataJoint diagrams is how **line styles indicate relationship types**. There are three types of lines, each conveying specific information about how tables are related.\n\n## The Three Line Styles\n\n### 1. Thick Solid Line (\u2501\u2501\u2501)\n\n**Meaning**: One-to-one relationship where the foreign key constitutes the **entire primary key** of the child table.\n\n**Conceptual Model**: The child entity is a **specialized extension or elaboration** of the parent entity. The child doesn't have its own independent identity\u2014it IS the parent, just with additional information attached.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Child table shares the exact same primary key as the parent\n- Creates the strongest form of dependency and unified identity\n- Child inherits the parent's complete identity\n- Perfect for adding optional or modular information to an entity\n- Enables direct joins across multiple levels of hierarchy\n\n**Example Use Cases**:\n- Workflow sequences: Order \u2192 Shipment \u2192 Delivery (each step extends the order)\n- Optional entity extensions: Customer \u2192 CustomerPreferences (preferences extend customer)\n- Modular data splits: Experiment \u2192 ExperimentNotes (notes extend experiment)\n- One-to-one specializations where child adds detail without changing identity\n\n**Think of it as**: \"Child extends parent\" or \"Child specializes parent\"\n\n### 2. Thin Solid Line (\u2500\u2500\u2500)\n\n**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is **part of** (but not all of) the child's primary key.\n\n**Conceptual Model**: The child entity **belongs to or is contained within** the parent entity. The child has its own identity, but only within the context of its parent. Multiple children can exist for each parent, each identified by the parent's key plus additional distinguishing attributes.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Child table has a composite primary key: parent's PK + additional field(s)\n- Creates hierarchical ownership or containment structures\n- Child's identity is contextualized by parent (e.g., \"Account #3 of Customer #42\")\n- Parent's primary key \"cascades\" down, becoming part of child's identity\n- Enables direct joins to ancestors without intermediate tables\n\n**Example Use Cases**:\n- Hierarchies: Study \u2192 Subject \u2192 Session \u2192 Scan (sessions belong to subjects)\n- Ownership: Customer \u2192 Account (accounts belong to customers)\n- Containment: Folder \u2192 File (files are contained in folders)\n- Parts-of: Order \u2192 OrderItem (items are parts of orders)\n\n**Think of it as**: \"Child belongs to parent\" or \"Child is contained in parent\"\n\n### 3. Dashed Line (- - - -)\n\n**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is a **secondary attribute** (not part of the primary key).\n\n**Conceptual Model**: The child entity **references or associates with** the parent but maintains complete independence. The child has its own identity that is unrelated to the parent, and the parent is just one of many attributes describing the child.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Child table has its own independent primary key\n- Foreign key appears below the line (in secondary attributes)\n- Relationship is \"looser\" - no identity cascade\n- Cannot skip intermediate tables in joins\n- Relationship can be more easily changed or made optional\n\n**Example Use Cases**:\n- Optional associations: Product \u2192 Manufacturer (product exists independently)\n- References that might change: Employee \u2192 Department (employee might transfer)\n- Loose couplings: Document \u2192 Author (document has independent identity)\n- When child entity has independent identity from parent\n\n**Think of it as**: \"Child references parent\" or \"Child is loosely associated with parent\"\n\n## Summary: The Conceptual Framework\n\nUnderstanding the semantic difference between line types:\n\n| Line Type | Semantic Relationship | Identity | Cardinality |\n|-----------|----------------------|----------|-------------|\n| **Thick Solid** | Extension/Specialization | Shared | One-to-one |\n| **Thin Solid** | Containment/Belonging | Contextualized | One-to-many |\n| **Dashed** | Reference/Association | Independent | One-to-many |\n\n**Key Insight**: Solid lines (thick or thin) indicate that the parent's identity becomes part of the child's identity, either completely (thick) or partially (thin). Dashed lines indicate the child maintains its own independent identity."

Once an order is placed, it may or may not be shipped.

    "# Practical Tips for Working with Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Read a Schema Quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "When encountering a new schema diagram, follow this systematic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Independent Entities** (top of diagram, underlined)\n",
    "   - These are your starting points for data entry\n",
    "   - No dependencies on other tables\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Trace the Solid Lines** (thick or thin)\n",
    "   - Follow the cascading primary keys\n",
    "   - Understand which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Spot Association Tables** (converging patterns)\n",
    "   - Look for tables with multiple foreign keys in their primary key\n",
    "   - These represent many-to-many relationships\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Check Line Thickness**\n",
    "   - Thick lines = one-to-one relationships (workflow steps, optional extensions)\n",
    "   - Thin lines = one-to-many hierarchies (ownership, containment)\n",
    "   - Dashed lines = one-to-many loose associations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing with Diagrams in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a new schema, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Solid Lines When**:\n",
    "- Building hierarchical structures (Study \u2192 Subject \u2192 Session)\n",
    "- Creating workflow sequences (Order \u2192 Ship \u2192 Deliver)\n",
    "- You want to enable direct joins across levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Dashed Lines When**:\n",
    "- Child has independent identity from parent\n",
    "- Relationship might change frequently\n",
    "- You don't want primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Thick Lines When**:\n",
    "- Creating one-to-one relationships\n",
    "- Extending entities with optional information\n",
    "- Modeling sequential workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram-Driven Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram structure directly informs query patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solid Line Paths** (direct joins possible):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study \u2192 Subject \u2192 Session are connected by solid lines:\n",
    "Study * Session  # Valid join, no need to include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dashed Line Paths** (must include intermediate tables):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study ---> Subject (dashed), Subject \u2192 Session (solid):\n",
    "Study * Subject * Session  # Must include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns at a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Line Type | Primary Key Structure | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Independent entities | None (top level) | Own PK | Starting points |\n",
    "| Hierarchy | Thin solid | Parent PK + own field(s) | Containment, ownership |\n",
    "| Sequence | Thick solid | Parent PK only | Workflows, one-to-one |\n",
    "| Secondary reference | Dashed | Own PK | Association |\n",
    "| Association table | Multiple thin solid | Multiple parent PKs | Many-to-many |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Jupyter Notebooks**:\n",
    "- **Hover** over tables to see complete definitions (also works if you save the diagram as a SVG file)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering Diagrams**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Show only specific tables\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + dj.Diagram(Table2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate dependencies\n",

    "- **Communicating** design decisions visually\n",
    "- **Planning** query strategies\n",
    "- **Validating** relationship structures\n",

    "The key is understanding that **line style encodes relationship semantics**: thick solid lines for one-to-one, thin solid lines for cascading one-to-many, and dashed lines for non-cascading one-to-many relationships. This visual language makes complex schemas comprehensible at a glance.\n"
