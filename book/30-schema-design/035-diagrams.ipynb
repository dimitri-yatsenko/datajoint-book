    "\n",
    "Schema diagrams are essential tools for understanding and designing relational databases. They provide a visual representation of tables and their relationships, making complex schemas easier to comprehend at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several diagramming notations have been used for designing relational schemas, as already introduced in the section on [Relational Theory](../20-concepts/01-relational.md). Common notations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chen's Entity-Relationship (ER) Notation**: Uses rectangles for entities and diamonds for relationships\n",
    "* **Crow's Foot Notation**: Uses symbols at line endpoints to indicate cardinality (one, many, optional)\n",
    "* **UML Class Diagrams**: Adapted from object-oriented modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint uses its own diagramming notation that is specifically designed for working with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and makes relationship types immediately visible through line styles."

    "## Comparison to Other Diagramming Notations\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint's diagramming approach differs significantly from traditional database diagramming notations. Understanding these differences helps you appreciate the design philosophy behind DataJoint and how to read diagrams effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chen's Entity-Relationship (ER) Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chen's notation**, developed by Peter Chen in 1976, makes a strict distinction between:\n",
    "- **Entities** (rectangles): Things that exist independently (e.g., Customer, Product)\n",
    "- **Relationships** (diamonds): Associations between entities (e.g., \"purchases\", \"owns\")\n",
    "- **Attributes** (ovals): Properties of entities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A many-to-many relationship between `Customer` and `Product` would be drawn as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Customer] ──── <purchases> ──── [Product]\n",
    "    1              M:N              1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from DataJoint**:\n",
    "- DataJoint **does not distinguish** between entity tables and relationship tables—both are just tables\n",
    "- In DataJoint, association tables (like `CustomerProduct`) appear as regular tables with converging foreign keys\n",
    "- **Why DataJoint differs**: The boundary between entities and relationships is often blurred. For example, a synapse between neurons could be viewed as either an entity (with properties like strength, neurotransmitter type) or as a relationship (connecting two neurons). DataJoint treats everything uniformly as tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crow's Foot Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot notation** (also called Information Engineering notation) uses symbols at line endpoints to indicate cardinality:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer ||────o{ Order\n",
    "         ||────o{ indicates \"one to zero-or-many\"\n",
    "         \n",
    "Symbols:\n",
    "|| = exactly one\n",
    "|o = zero or one  \n",
    "}o = zero or many\n",
    "}| = one or many\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Endpoint symbols vs. line styles**: Crow's Foot puts cardinality information at line endpoints; DataJoint uses line thickness and style (thick/thin/dashed)\n",
    "- **No directionality**: Crow's Foot diagrams don't inherently have a top-to-bottom flow; DataJoint diagrams always show dependencies flowing downward\n",
    "- **Nullable indication**: Crow's Foot explicitly shows optional relationships with the 'o' symbol; DataJoint doesn't show nullable foreign keys in the diagram\n",
    "- **Primary key cascade**: Crow's Foot doesn't distinguish between foreign keys in primary keys vs. secondary attributes; this is DataJoint's most important visual feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### UML Class Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** was designed for object-oriented programming but is sometimes adapted for database design:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐\n",
    "│  Customer   │1      *│   Order     │\n",
    "│─────────────│◆────────│─────────────│\n",
    "│ customerId  │         │ orderId     │\n",
    "│ name        │         │ orderDate   │\n",
    "└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Composition vs. aggregation**: UML uses filled vs. hollow diamonds to show ownership strength; DataJoint uses solid vs. dashed lines\n",
    "- **Object-oriented focus**: UML emphasizes inheritance and methods; DataJoint focuses purely on data relationships\n",
    "- **Multiplicity notation**: UML uses `1`, `*`, `0..1` at line ends; DataJoint uses line styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### DataJoint's Unique Features\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes DataJoint diagrams distinctive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Requirement**\n",
    "   - **No cycles allowed**: Foreign keys cannot form loops\n",
    "   - **Automatic layout**: All dependencies point in one direction (top-to-bottom)\n",
    "   - **Workflow interpretation**: Diagrams naturally represent operational sequences\n",
    "   - Other notations allow cycles (e.g., Employee → Department → Manager → Employee)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Line Style Encodes Semantic Information**\n",
    "   - **Thick solid**: Extension/specialization (one-to-one, shared identity)\n",
    "   - **Thin solid**: Containment/belonging (one-to-many, cascading identity)\n",
    "   - **Dashed**: Reference/association (one-to-many, independent identity)\n",
    "   - Other notations use line endpoints or labels, not line style itself\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Primary Key Cascade Visibility**\n",
    "   - **Solid lines** (thick or thin) mean parent's primary key becomes part of child's identity\n",
    "   - This is critical for understanding which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "   - No other notation makes this distinction visible\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Distinction Between Entities and Relationships**\n",
    "   - Association tables look like any other table\n",
    "   - Reflects reality: relationships often have attributes and can participate in other relationships\n",
    "   - Example: A `Synapse` table connecting neurons could be an entity (with properties) or a relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Underlined Names for Independent Entities**\n",
    "   - **Underlined**: Table has its own independent primary key (a \"dimension\")\n",
    "   - **Not underlined**: Table's primary key is inherited from parent (an \"extension\")\n",
    "   - Helps identify which tables are starting points vs. elaborations\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why DataJoint's Approach Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The DAG constraint and line style notation are not just aesthetic choices—they reflect a **design philosophy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schemas as Workflows**: Because there are no cycles, you can read any DataJoint schema as a sequence of operations or transformations. Start at the top (independent entities) and work your way down (derived results).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Simplicity**: Solid lines tell you which tables can be joined directly. If you can trace a path of solid lines between two tables, you can join them without including intermediate tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identity Semantics**: The line style immediately tells you whether entities share identity (thick), have contextualized identity (thin), or maintain independent identity (dashed).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Self-References**: The no-cycles rule means you never have a table with a foreign key to itself. Instead, you create association tables (like `ReportsTo` connecting employees to managers), which makes relationships explicit and queryable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Non-DataJoint Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "When you encounter schemas designed in other notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Look for cycles**: If present, you'll need to break them into association tables for DataJoint\n",
    "- **Identify many-to-many relationships**: These always need association tables in DataJoint (and in actual SQL)\n",
    "- **Check foreign key placement**: Determine whether they should be in primary keys (solid lines) or secondary attributes (dashed lines)\n",
    "- **Use `spawn_missing_classes()`**: DataJoint can automatically generate Python classes from existing MySQL/MariaDB databases"

    "### Comparing the Two Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "The MySQL tutorial ERD (above) and the DataJoint diagram (above) represent the same database, but there are significant visual and conceptual differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Direction and Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot (MySQL ERD)**:\n",
    "- No inherent direction—tables are arranged for visual balance\n",
    "- Relationships flow in all directions (left, right, up, down)\n",
    "- Must read cardinality symbols at both ends of each line to understand relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint Diagram**:\n",
    "- Strict top-to-bottom flow (directed acyclic graph)\n",
    "- Dependencies always point downward (parent above, child below)\n",
    "- Can read the schema as a workflow from top to bottom\n",
    "- **Insight**: The vertical position tells you dependency order—tables at the top can be populated first\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Cardinality Indication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot Notation**:\n",
    "- Uses symbols at line endpoints: `||` (one), `o` (zero/optional), `{` (many)\n",
    "- Example: `||────o{` means \"one to zero-or-many\"\n",
    "- Shows both sides of the relationship explicitly\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Makes optional relationships (nullable foreign keys) visible\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint Notation**:\n",
    "- Uses line thickness and style: thick solid, thin solid, dashed\n",
    "- Line style indicates whether foreign key is in primary key or not\n",
    "- Does **not** show nullable foreign keys (must check table definition)\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Line style conveys semantic meaning (extension vs. containment vs. reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Entity vs. Relationship Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot / Chen's ER**:\n",
    "- In Chen's notation, relationships are drawn as diamonds\n",
    "- Crow's Foot treats all tables uniformly but conceptually distinguishes entities from relationships\n",
    "- Many-to-many relationships are often shown with special notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **No distinction** between entity tables and association tables—all are tables\n",
    "- Association tables (like `CustomerAccount`) look identical to entity tables\n",
    "- Recognize associations by their converging foreign key pattern\n",
    "- **Philosophy**: \"A synapse between neurons is both an entity (with properties) and a relationship (connecting neurons)—why force a distinction?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Primary Key Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot**:\n",
    "- Does not visually distinguish between foreign keys in primary keys vs. secondary attributes\n",
    "- Cannot tell from the diagram whether you can join tables directly or need intermediate tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Solid lines** (thick or thin) mean foreign key is in primary key → primary key cascades\n",
    "- **Dashed lines** mean foreign key is secondary → no cascade\n",
    "- **Critical advantage**: You can see at a glance which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "- Example: If `A → B → C` are connected by solid lines, then `A * C` is a valid join\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Handling Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Notations**:\n",
    "- Allow cyclic relationships (e.g., Employee → Department → Manager → Employee)\n",
    "- Self-referencing tables are common (Employee table with manager_id field)\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **No cycles allowed**—all schemas must be directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "- Self-referencing tables are avoided\n",
    "- Instead, use association tables: `Employee` → `ReportsTo` → `Employee` (renamed)\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Schemas can always be laid out top-to-bottom as workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Table Independence (Dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Notations**:\n",
    "- Don't visually distinguish between independent entities and dependent entities\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Underlined table names**: Independent entities (dimensions) with their own primary key\n",
    "- **Non-underlined names**: Dependent entities whose primary key is inherited from parent\n",
    "- Helps identify which tables are \"starting points\" vs. \"elaborations\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Comparison Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple scenario: Customers placing Orders containing Items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot would show**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer ||────o{ Order o{────|| OrderItem }o────|| Product\n",
    "   1              M         M              M           1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint shows**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer        Product\n",
    "    │              │\n",
    "    │ (dashed)     │ (dashed)\n",
    "    ↓              ↓\n",
    "  Order    ───────┘\n",
    "    │ (thin solid)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "OrderItem\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading the DataJoint diagram**:\n",
    "- Dashed lines to `Order`: Customer and Product references are secondary (Order has its own ID)\n",
    "- Thin solid line to `OrderItem`: Items belong to orders, identified as (order_id, item_number)\n",
    "- All solid lines point down: Top-to-bottom workflow (create customers/products, then orders, then items)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Each Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chen's ER Notation**:\n",
    "- ✅ Clear conceptual modeling (entities vs. relationships explicit)\n",
    "- ✅ Good for initial design discussions with non-technical stakeholders\n",
    "- ❌ Awkward for implementation (relationship diamonds don't map directly to tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot Notation**:\n",
    "- ✅ Shows nullable relationships clearly\n",
    "- ✅ Explicit cardinality on both sides\n",
    "- ✅ Widely recognized in industry\n",
    "- ❌ No directionality makes complex schemas harder to read\n",
    "- ❌ Doesn't show primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint Notation**:\n",
    "- ✅ Line style conveys semantic meaning (extension, containment, reference)\n",
    "- ✅ Solid lines reveal which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "- ✅ DAG structure makes schemas readable as workflows\n",
    "- ✅ Underlined names identify independent entities\n",
    "- ❌ Nullable foreign keys not visible\n",
    "- ❌ Secondary unique constraints not visible\n",
    "- ❌ Less familiar to those trained in traditional notations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices: When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Chen's ER** for: Initial conceptual modeling with stakeholders\n",
    "- **Use Crow's Foot** for: Documentation of existing databases, focusing on cardinality\n",
    "- **Use DataJoint** for: Scientific workflows, hierarchical data, when query patterns matter\n",
    "- **Use UML** for: Object-relational mapping in application development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting Between Notations\n",
    "\n",
    "When converting from Crow's Foot or ER diagrams to DataJoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify independent entities** → These become top-level tables (underlined)\n",
    "2. **Find many-to-many relationships** → Create association tables with both foreign keys in primary key\n",
    "3. **Determine foreign key placement**:\n",
    "   - Does child belong to parent? → Foreign key in primary key (solid line)\n",
    "   - Does child reference parent? → Foreign key in secondary attributes (dashed line)\n",
    "4. **Break any cycles** → Create association tables to maintain acyclic property\n",
    "5. **Check for self-references** → Replace with association tables using renamed foreign keys"

    "   - DataJoint requires: `Employee` → `Department` → `DepartmentManager` (acyclic)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Density**:\n",
    "   - Crow's Foot shows more detail (nullable, optional)\n",
    "   - DataJoint emphasizes structure and flow\n",
    "   - Both require hovering/inspection for complete details\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Semantic Meaning**:\n",
    "   - Traditional: Focus on cardinality (how many)\n",
    "   - DataJoint: Focus on identity cascade (how entities relate conceptually)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reading Strategy**:\n",
    "   - Crow's Foot: Examine each endpoint's symbols\n",

    "\n",
    "In this diagram, observe the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Green boxes with underlined names**: These are the tables. The underline indicates these are independent entities (dimensions) with their own primary keys.\n",
    "* **Thin solid lines**: Both edges use thin solid lines, indicating that the foreign keys from `Assignment` are part of its primary key.\n",
    "* **Converging pattern**: The `Assignment` table has two foreign keys converging into it, which is the visual signature of an association table creating a many-to-many relationship.\n",
    "* **Top-to-bottom layout**: Independent entities (`Employee` and `Project`) are at the top, and the dependent table (`Assignment`) is at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Features**: In Jupyter notebooks, you can hover over any table in the diagram to see its complete definition, including all attributes and constraints.\n"

    "# Understanding Line Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important feature of DataJoint diagrams is how **line styles indicate relationship types**. There are three types of lines, each conveying specific information about how tables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Three Line Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Thick Solid Line (━━━)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-one relationship where the foreign key constitutes the **entire primary key** of the child table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Model**: The child entity is a **specialized extension or elaboration** of the parent entity. The child doesn't have its own independent identity—it IS the parent, just with additional information attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table shares the exact same primary key as the parent\n",
    "- Creates the strongest form of dependency and unified identity\n",
    "- Child inherits the parent's complete identity\n",
    "- Perfect for adding optional or modular information to an entity\n",
    "- Enables direct joins across multiple levels of hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Workflow sequences: Order → Shipment → Delivery (each step extends the order)\n",
    "- Optional entity extensions: Customer → CustomerPreferences (preferences extend customer)\n",
    "- Modular data splits: Experiment → ExperimentNotes (notes extend experiment)\n",
    "- One-to-one specializations where child adds detail without changing identity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as**: \"Child extends parent\" or \"Child specializes parent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Thin Solid Line (───)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is **part of** (but not all of) the child's primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Model**: The child entity **belongs to or is contained within** the parent entity. The child has its own identity, but only within the context of its parent. Multiple children can exist for each parent, each identified by the parent's key plus additional distinguishing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table has a composite primary key: parent's PK + additional field(s)\n",
    "- Creates hierarchical ownership or containment structures\n",
    "- Child's identity is contextualized by parent (e.g., \"Account #3 of Customer #42\")\n",
    "- Parent's primary key \"cascades\" down, becoming part of child's identity\n",
    "- Enables direct joins to ancestors without intermediate tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Hierarchies: Study → Subject → Session → Scan (sessions belong to subjects)\n",
    "- Ownership: Customer → Account (accounts belong to customers)\n",
    "- Containment: Folder → File (files are contained in folders)\n",
    "- Parts-of: Order → OrderItem (items are parts of orders)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as**: \"Child belongs to parent\" or \"Child is contained in parent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dashed Line (- - - -)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is a **secondary attribute** (not part of the primary key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Model**: The child entity **references or associates with** the parent but maintains complete independence. The child has its own identity that is unrelated to the parent, and the parent is just one of many attributes describing the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table has its own independent primary key\n",
    "- Foreign key appears below the line (in secondary attributes)\n",
    "- Relationship is \"looser\" - no identity cascade\n",
    "- Cannot skip intermediate tables in joins\n",
    "- Relationship can be more easily changed or made optional\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Optional associations: Product → Manufacturer (product exists independently)\n",
    "- References that might change: Employee → Department (employee might transfer)\n",
    "- Loose couplings: Document → Author (document has independent identity)\n",
    "- When child entity has independent identity from parent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as**: \"Child references parent\" or \"Child is loosely associated with parent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary: The Conceptual Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the semantic difference between line types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Line Type | Semantic Relationship | Identity | Cardinality |\n",
    "|-----------|----------------------|----------|-------------|\n",

    "- *\"There can be at most one child for each parent\"*\n",
    "- *\"The child and parent share the same identity\"*\n",

    "# What Diagrams Show and Don't Show\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the limitations of diagram notation is just as important as understanding what they do show.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Diagrams Clearly Indicate\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Line Style (Thick/Thin/Dashed)**:\n",
    "- Whether foreign keys are in primary key or secondary attributes\n",
    "- Whether relationships are one-to-one (thick) or one-to-many (thin/dashed)\n",
    "- Whether primary keys cascade through relationships (solid lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Direction of Dependencies**:\n",
    "- Which table depends on which (arrows point from parent to child)\n",
    "- Workflow order (top to bottom)\n",
    "- Which tables are independent vs. dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Table Types**:\n",
    "- Underlined names = independent entities (dimensions)\n",
    "- Non-underlined names = dependent entities (no independent identity)\n",
    "- Color coding for table tiers (Manual, Lookup, Imported, Computed, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Association Patterns**:\n",
    "- Converging lines indicate association tables\n",
    "- Many-to-many relationships (two foreign keys in primary key)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Diagrams Don't Show\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Nullable Foreign Keys**:\n",
    "- Whether a foreign key is nullable (allows NULL values)\n",
    "- Cannot distinguish between mandatory and optional relationships\n",
    "- Must examine table definition to see nullable modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Secondary Unique Constraints**:\n",
    "- Unique indexes on secondary attributes\n",
    "- Could convert a one-to-many into a one-to-one relationship\n",
    "- Not visible in the diagram at all\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Actual Attribute Names**:\n",
    "- Only table names are shown (hover to see attributes)\n",
    "- Foreign key field names might be renamed via projection\n",
    "- Must inspect definition to see exact field names\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Data Types and Constraints**:\n",
    "- Cannot see CHECK constraints, default values, etc.\n",
    "- Must examine table definition for these details\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Composite Unique Constraints**:\n",
    "- Complex uniqueness rules beyond the primary key\n",
    "- May fundamentally change relationship semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Principle**: DataJoint users generally avoid secondary unique constraints when the primary key structure can enforce uniqueness. Making foreign keys part of the primary key (creating solid lines) provides two major benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visual Clarity**: The relationship type is immediately obvious from the diagram\n",

    "# Practical Tips for Working with Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Read a Schema Quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "When encountering a new schema diagram, follow this systematic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Independent Entities** (top of diagram, underlined)\n",
    "   - These are your starting points for data entry\n",
    "   - No dependencies on other tables\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Trace the Solid Lines** (thick or thin)\n",
    "   - Follow the cascading primary keys\n",
    "   - Understand which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Spot Association Tables** (converging patterns)\n",
    "   - Look for tables with multiple foreign keys in their primary key\n",
    "   - These represent many-to-many relationships\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Check Line Thickness**\n",
    "   - Thick lines = one-to-one relationships (workflow steps, optional extensions)\n",
    "   - Thin lines = one-to-many hierarchies (ownership, containment)\n",
    "   - Dashed lines = one-to-many loose associations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing with Diagrams in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a new schema, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Solid Lines When**:\n",
    "- Building hierarchical structures (Study → Subject → Session)\n",
    "- Creating workflow sequences (Order → Ship → Deliver)\n",
    "- You want to enable direct joins across levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Dashed Lines When**:\n",
    "- Child has independent identity from parent\n",
    "- Relationship might change frequently\n",
    "- You don't want primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Thick Lines When**:\n",
    "- Creating one-to-one relationships\n",
    "- Extending entities with optional information\n",
    "- Modeling sequential workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram-Driven Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram structure directly informs query patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solid Line Paths** (direct joins possible):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study → Subject → Session are connected by solid lines:\n",
    "Study * Session  # Valid join, no need to include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dashed Line Paths** (must include intermediate tables):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study ---> Subject (dashed), Subject → Session (solid):\n",
    "Study * Subject * Session  # Must include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns at a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Line Type | Primary Key Structure | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Independent entities | None (top level) | Own PK | Starting points |\n",
    "| Hierarchy | Thin solid | Parent PK + own field(s) | Containment, ownership |\n",
    "| Sequence | Thick solid | Parent PK only | Workflows, one-to-one |\n",
    "| Secondary reference | Dashed | Own PK | Association |\n",
    "| Association table | Multiple thin solid | Multiple parent PKs | Many-to-many |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Jupyter Notebooks**:\n",
    "- **Hover** over tables to see complete definitions (also works if you save the diagram as a SVG file)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering Diagrams**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Show only specific tables\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + dj.Diagram(Table2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate dependencies\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate up to seven layears up in the graph\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and what depends on it  \n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + 1\n",

    "- **Communicating** design decisions visually\n",
    "- **Planning** query strategies\n",
    "- **Validating** relationship structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is understanding that **line style encodes relationship semantics**: thick solid lines for one-to-one, thin solid lines for cascading one-to-many, and dashed lines for non-cascading one-to-many relationships. This visual language makes complex schemas comprehensible at a glance.\n"
