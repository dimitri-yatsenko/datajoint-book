    "\n",
    "Schema diagrams are essential tools for understanding and designing relational databases. They provide a visual representation of tables and their relationships, making complex schemas easier to comprehend at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several diagramming notations have been used for designing relational schemas, as already introduced in the section on [Relational Theory](../20-concepts/01-relational.md). Common notations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chen's Entity-Relationship (ER) Notation**: Uses rectangles for entities and diamonds for relationships\n",
    "* **Crow's Foot Notation**: Uses symbols at line endpoints to indicate cardinality (one, many, optional)\n",
    "* **UML Class Diagrams**: Adapted from object-oriented modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint uses its own diagramming notation that is specifically designed for working with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and makes relationship types immediately visible through line styles."

    "* **Direction** always flows from parent (referenced) to child (referencing) tables\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Three Line Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Thick Solid Line (━━━)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-one relationship where the foreign key constitutes the **entire primary key** of the child table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table shares the exact same primary key as the parent\n",
    "- Creates the strongest form of dependency\n",
    "- Child and parent have \"unified identity\"\n",
    "- Enables direct joins across multiple levels of hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Workflow sequences (Order → Shipment → Delivery)\n",
    "- Optional entity extensions (Customer → Account when each customer has at most one account)\n",
    "- One-to-one splits for modularity or access control\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Thin Solid Line (───)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is **part of** (but not all of) the child's primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table has a composite primary key that includes the parent's primary key plus additional attributes\n",
    "- Creates hierarchical structures\n",
    "- Parent's primary key \"cascades\" through the relationship\n",
    "- Enables direct joins to ancestors without intermediate tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Hierarchies (Study → Subject → Session → Scan)\n",
    "- Entities owned by or contained within others\n",
    "- Multi-level categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dashed Line (- - - -)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is a **secondary attribute** (not part of the primary key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table has its own independent primary key\n",
    "- Foreign key appears below the line (in secondary attributes)\n",
    "- Relationship is \"looser\" - no identity cascade\n",
    "- Cannot skip intermediate tables in joins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Optional associations\n",
    "- References that might change over time\n",

    "# What Diagrams Show and Don't Show\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the limitations of diagram notation is just as important as understanding what they do show.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Diagrams Clearly Indicate\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Line Style (Thick/Thin/Dashed)**:\n",
    "- Whether foreign keys are in primary key or secondary attributes\n",
    "- Whether relationships are one-to-one (thick) or one-to-many (thin/dashed)\n",
    "- Whether primary keys cascade through relationships (solid lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Direction of Dependencies**:\n",
    "- Which table depends on which (arrows point from parent to child)\n",
    "- Workflow order (top to bottom)\n",
    "- Which tables are independent vs. dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Table Types**:\n",
    "- Underlined names = independent entities (dimensions)\n",
    "- Non-underlined names = dependent entities (no independent identity)\n",
    "- Color coding for table tiers (Manual, Lookup, Imported, Computed, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Association Patterns**:\n",
    "- Converging lines indicate association tables\n",
    "- Many-to-many relationships (two foreign keys in primary key)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Diagrams Don't Show\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Nullable Foreign Keys**:\n",
    "- Whether a foreign key is nullable (allows NULL values)\n",
    "- Cannot distinguish between mandatory and optional relationships\n",
    "- Must examine table definition to see nullable modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Secondary Unique Constraints**:\n",
    "- Unique indexes on secondary attributes\n",
    "- Could convert a one-to-many into a one-to-one relationship\n",
    "- Not visible in the diagram at all\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Actual Attribute Names**:\n",
    "- Only table names are shown (hover to see attributes)\n",
    "- Foreign key field names might be renamed via projection\n",
    "- Must inspect definition to see exact field names\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Data Types and Constraints**:\n",
    "- Cannot see CHECK constraints, default values, etc.\n",
    "- Must examine table definition for these details\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Composite Unique Constraints**:\n",
    "- Complex uniqueness rules beyond the primary key\n",
    "- May fundamentally change relationship semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Principle**: DataJoint users generally avoid secondary unique constraints when the primary key structure can enforce uniqueness. Making foreign keys part of the primary key (creating solid lines) provides two major benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visual Clarity**: The relationship type is immediately obvious from the diagram\n",
    "2. **Query Simplicity**: Primary keys cascade through foreign keys, enabling direct joins between distant tables\n"

    "# Practical Tips for Working with Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Read a Schema Quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "When encountering a new schema diagram, follow this systematic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Independent Entities** (top of diagram, underlined)\n",
    "   - These are your starting points for data entry\n",
    "   - No dependencies on other tables\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Trace the Solid Lines** (thick or thin)\n",
    "   - Follow the cascading primary keys\n",
    "   - Understand which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Spot Association Tables** (converging patterns)\n",
    "   - Look for tables with multiple foreign keys in their primary key\n",
    "   - These represent many-to-many relationships\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Check Line Thickness**\n",
    "   - Thick lines = one-to-one relationships (workflow steps, optional extensions)\n",
    "   - Thin lines = one-to-many hierarchies (ownership, containment)\n",
    "   - Dashed lines = one-to-many loose associations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing with Diagrams in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a new schema, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Solid Lines When**:\n",
    "- Building hierarchical structures (Study → Subject → Session)\n",
    "- Creating workflow sequences (Order → Ship → Deliver)\n",
    "- You want to enable direct joins across levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Dashed Lines When**:\n",
    "- Child has independent identity from parent\n",
    "- Relationship might change frequently\n",
    "- You don't want primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Thick Lines When**:\n",
    "- Creating one-to-one relationships\n",
    "- Extending entities with optional information\n",
    "- Modeling sequential workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram-Driven Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram structure directly informs query patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solid Line Paths** (direct joins possible):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study → Subject → Session are connected by solid lines:\n",
    "Study * Session  # Valid join, no need to include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dashed Line Paths** (must include intermediate tables):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study ---> Subject (dashed), Subject → Session (solid):\n",
    "Study * Subject * Session  # Must include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns at a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Line Type | Primary Key Structure | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Independent entities | None (top level) | Own PK | Starting points |\n",
    "| Hierarchy | Thin solid | Parent PK + own field(s) | Containment, ownership |\n",
    "| Sequence | Thick solid | Parent PK only | Workflows, one-to-one |\n",
    "| Secondary reference | Dashed | Own PK | Association |\n",
    "| Association table | Multiple thin solid | Multiple parent PKs | Many-to-many |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Jupyter Notebooks**:\n",
    "- **Hover** over tables to see complete definitions (also works if you save the diagram as a SVG file)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering Diagrams**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Show only specific tables\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + dj.Diagram(Table2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate dependencies\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate up to seven layears up in the graph\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and what depends on it  \n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and what depends on it up to seven layers down in the graph\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + 7\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint diagrams are powerful tools for:\n",
    "- **Understanding** existing schemas quickly\n",
    "- **Communicating** design decisions visually\n",
    "- **Planning** query strategies\n",
    "- **Validating** relationship structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is understanding that **line style encodes relationship semantics**: thick solid lines for one-to-one, thin solid lines for cascading one-to-many, and dashed lines for non-cascading one-to-many relationships. This visual language makes complex schemas comprehensible at a glance.\n"
