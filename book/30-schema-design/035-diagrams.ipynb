    "Schema diagrams are essential tools for understanding and designing relational databases. They provide a visual representation of tables and their relationships, making complex schemas easier to comprehend at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several diagramming notations have been used for designing relational schemas, as already introduced in the section on [Relational Theory](../20-concepts/01-relational.md). Common notations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chen's Entity-Relationship (ER) Notation**: Uses rectangles for entities and diamonds for relationships\n",
    "* **Crow's Foot Notation**: Uses symbols at line endpoints to indicate cardinality (one, many, optional)\n",
    "* **UML Class Diagrams**: Adapted from object-oriented modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint uses its own diagramming notation that is specifically designed for working with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and makes relationship types immediately visible through line styles."

    "\n",
    "In this diagram, observe the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Green boxes with underlined names**: These are the tables. The underline indicates these are independent entities (dimensions) with their own primary keys.\n",
    "* **Thin solid lines**: Both edges use thin solid lines, indicating that the foreign keys from `Assignment` are part of its primary key.\n",
    "* **Converging pattern**: The `Assignment` table has two foreign keys converging into it, which is the visual signature of an association table creating a many-to-many relationship.\n",
    "* **Top-to-bottom layout**: Independent entities (`Employee` and `Project`) are at the top, and the dependent table (`Assignment`) is at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Features**: In Jupyter notebooks, you can hover over any table in the diagram to see its complete definition, including all attributes and constraints.\n"

    "# Understanding Line Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important feature of DataJoint diagrams is how **line styles indicate relationship types**. There are three types of lines, each conveying specific information about how tables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Three Line Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Thick Solid Line (━━━)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-one relationship where the foreign key constitutes the **entire primary key** of the child table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Model**: The child entity is a **specialized extension or elaboration** of the parent entity. The child doesn't have its own independent identity—it IS the parent, just with additional information attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table shares the exact same primary key as the parent\n",
    "- Creates the strongest form of dependency and unified identity\n",
    "- Child inherits the parent's complete identity\n",
    "- Perfect for adding optional or modular information to an entity\n",
    "- Enables direct joins across multiple levels of hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Workflow sequences: Order → Shipment → Delivery (each step extends the order)\n",
    "- Optional entity extensions: Customer → CustomerPreferences (preferences extend customer)\n",
    "- Modular data splits: Experiment → ExperimentNotes (notes extend experiment)\n",
    "- One-to-one specializations where child adds detail without changing identity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as**: \"Child extends parent\" or \"Child specializes parent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Thin Solid Line (───)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is **part of** (but not all of) the child's primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Model**: The child entity **belongs to or is contained within** the parent entity. The child has its own identity, but only within the context of its parent. Multiple children can exist for each parent, each identified by the parent's key plus additional distinguishing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table has a composite primary key: parent's PK + additional field(s)\n",
    "- Creates hierarchical ownership or containment structures\n",
    "- Child's identity is contextualized by parent (e.g., \"Account #3 of Customer #42\")\n",
    "- Parent's primary key \"cascades\" down, becoming part of child's identity\n",
    "- Enables direct joins to ancestors without intermediate tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Hierarchies: Study → Subject → Session → Scan (sessions belong to subjects)\n",
    "- Ownership: Customer → Account (accounts belong to customers)\n",
    "- Containment: Folder → File (files are contained in folders)\n",
    "- Parts-of: Order → OrderItem (items are parts of orders)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as**: \"Child belongs to parent\" or \"Child is contained in parent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dashed Line (- - - -)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-many relationship where the foreign key is a **secondary attribute** (not part of the primary key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Model**: The child entity **references or associates with** the parent but maintains complete independence. The child has its own identity that is unrelated to the parent, and the parent is just one of many attributes describing the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table has its own independent primary key\n",
    "- Foreign key appears below the line (in secondary attributes)\n",
    "- Relationship is \"looser\" - no identity cascade\n",
    "- Cannot skip intermediate tables in joins\n",
    "- Relationship can be more easily changed or made optional\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Optional associations: Product → Manufacturer (product exists independently)\n",
    "- References that might change: Employee → Department (employee might transfer)\n",
    "- Loose couplings: Document → Author (document has independent identity)\n",
    "- When child entity has independent identity from parent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as**: \"Child references parent\" or \"Child is loosely associated with parent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary: The Conceptual Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the semantic difference between line types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Line Type | Semantic Relationship | Identity | Cardinality |\n",
    "|-----------|----------------------|----------|-------------|\n",

    "\n",

    "- *\"There can be at most one child for each parent\"*\n",
    "- *\"The child and parent share the same identity\"*\n",

    "# What Diagrams Show and Don't Show\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the limitations of diagram notation is just as important as understanding what they do show.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Diagrams Clearly Indicate\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Line Style (Thick/Thin/Dashed)**:\n",
    "- Whether foreign keys are in primary key or secondary attributes\n",
    "- Whether relationships are one-to-one (thick) or one-to-many (thin/dashed)\n",
    "- Whether primary keys cascade through relationships (solid lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Direction of Dependencies**:\n",
    "- Which table depends on which (arrows point from parent to child)\n",
    "- Workflow order (top to bottom)\n",
    "- Which tables are independent vs. dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Table Types**:\n",
    "- Underlined names = independent entities (dimensions)\n",
    "- Non-underlined names = dependent entities (no independent identity)\n",
    "- Color coding for table tiers (Manual, Lookup, Imported, Computed, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Association Patterns**:\n",
    "- Converging lines indicate association tables\n",
    "- Many-to-many relationships (two foreign keys in primary key)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Diagrams Don't Show\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Nullable Foreign Keys**:\n",
    "- Whether a foreign key is nullable (allows NULL values)\n",
    "- Cannot distinguish between mandatory and optional relationships\n",
    "- Must examine table definition to see nullable modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Secondary Unique Constraints**:\n",
    "- Unique indexes on secondary attributes\n",
    "- Could convert a one-to-many into a one-to-one relationship\n",
    "- Not visible in the diagram at all\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Actual Attribute Names**:\n",
    "- Only table names are shown (hover to see attributes)\n",
    "- Foreign key field names might be renamed via projection\n",
    "- Must inspect definition to see exact field names\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Data Types and Constraints**:\n",
    "- Cannot see CHECK constraints, default values, etc.\n",
    "- Must examine table definition for these details\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Composite Unique Constraints**:\n",
    "- Complex uniqueness rules beyond the primary key\n",
    "- May fundamentally change relationship semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Principle**: DataJoint users generally avoid secondary unique constraints when the primary key structure can enforce uniqueness. Making foreign keys part of the primary key (creating solid lines) provides two major benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visual Clarity**: The relationship type is immediately obvious from the diagram\n",

    "# Practical Tips for Working with Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Read a Schema Quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "When encountering a new schema diagram, follow this systematic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Independent Entities** (top of diagram, underlined)\n",
    "   - These are your starting points for data entry\n",
    "   - No dependencies on other tables\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Trace the Solid Lines** (thick or thin)\n",
    "   - Follow the cascading primary keys\n",
    "   - Understand which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Spot Association Tables** (converging patterns)\n",
    "   - Look for tables with multiple foreign keys in their primary key\n",
    "   - These represent many-to-many relationships\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Check Line Thickness**\n",
    "   - Thick lines = one-to-one relationships (workflow steps, optional extensions)\n",
    "   - Thin lines = one-to-many hierarchies (ownership, containment)\n",
    "   - Dashed lines = one-to-many loose associations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing with Diagrams in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a new schema, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Solid Lines When**:\n",
    "- Building hierarchical structures (Study → Subject → Session)\n",
    "- Creating workflow sequences (Order → Ship → Deliver)\n",
    "- You want to enable direct joins across levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Dashed Lines When**:\n",
    "- Child has independent identity from parent\n",
    "- Relationship might change frequently\n",
    "- You don't want primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Thick Lines When**:\n",
    "- Creating one-to-one relationships\n",
    "- Extending entities with optional information\n",
    "- Modeling sequential workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram-Driven Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram structure directly informs query patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solid Line Paths** (direct joins possible):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study → Subject → Session are connected by solid lines:\n",
    "Study * Session  # Valid join, no need to include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dashed Line Paths** (must include intermediate tables):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study ---> Subject (dashed), Subject → Session (solid):\n",
    "Study * Subject * Session  # Must include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns at a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Line Type | Primary Key Structure | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Independent entities | None (top level) | Own PK | Starting points |\n",
    "| Hierarchy | Thin solid | Parent PK + own field(s) | Containment, ownership |\n",
    "| Sequence | Thick solid | Parent PK only | Workflows, one-to-one |\n",
    "| Secondary reference | Dashed | Own PK | Association |\n",
    "| Association table | Multiple thin solid | Multiple parent PKs | Many-to-many |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Jupyter Notebooks**:\n",
    "- **Hover** over tables to see complete definitions (also works if you save the diagram as a SVG file)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering Diagrams**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Show only specific tables\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + dj.Diagram(Table2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate dependencies\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate up to seven layears up in the graph\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and what depends on it  \n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + 1\n",

    "- **Understanding** existing schemas quickly\n",
    "- **Communicating** design decisions visually\n",
    "- **Planning** query strategies\n",
    "- **Validating** relationship structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is understanding that **line style encodes relationship semantics**: thick solid lines for one-to-one, thin solid lines for cascading one-to-many, and dashed lines for non-cascading one-to-many relationships. This visual language makes complex schemas comprehensible at a glance.\n"
