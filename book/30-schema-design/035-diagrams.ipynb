    "Schema diagrams are essential tools for understanding and designing relational databases. They provide a visual representation of tables and their relationships, making complex schemas easier to comprehend at a glance.\n",

    "## Comparison to Other Diagramming Notations\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint's diagramming approach differs significantly from traditional database diagramming notations. Understanding these differences helps you appreciate the design philosophy behind DataJoint and how to read diagrams effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chen's Entity-Relationship (ER) Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chen's notation**, developed by Peter Chen in 1976, makes a strict distinction between:\n",
    "- **Entities** (rectangles): Things that exist independently (e.g., Customer, Product)\n",
    "- **Relationships** (diamonds): Associations between entities (e.g., \"purchases\", \"owns\")\n",
    "- **Attributes** (ovals): Properties of entities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A many-to-many relationship between `Customer` and `Product` would be drawn as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Customer] \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 <purchases> \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 [Product]\n",
    "    1              M:N              1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from DataJoint**:\n",
    "- DataJoint **does not distinguish** between entity tables and relationship tables\u2014both are just tables\n",
    "- In DataJoint, association tables (like `CustomerProduct`) appear as regular tables with converging foreign keys\n",
    "- **Why DataJoint differs**: The boundary between entities and relationships is often blurred. For example, a synapse between neurons could be viewed as either an entity (with properties like strength, neurotransmitter type) or as a relationship (connecting two neurons). DataJoint treats everything uniformly as tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crow's Foot Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot notation** (also called Information Engineering notation) uses symbols at line endpoints to indicate cardinality:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer ||\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500o{ Order\n",
    "         ||\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500o{ indicates \"one to zero-or-many\"\n",
    "         \n",
    "Symbols:\n",
    "|| = exactly one\n",
    "|o = zero or one  \n",
    "}o = zero or many\n",
    "}| = one or many\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Endpoint symbols vs. line styles**: Crow's Foot puts cardinality information at line endpoints; DataJoint uses line thickness and style (thick/thin/dashed)\n",
    "- **No directionality**: Crow's Foot diagrams don't inherently have a top-to-bottom flow; DataJoint diagrams always show dependencies flowing downward\n",
    "- **Nullable indication**: Crow's Foot explicitly shows optional relationships with the 'o' symbol; DataJoint doesn't show nullable foreign keys in the diagram\n",
    "- **Primary key cascade**: Crow's Foot doesn't distinguish between foreign keys in primary keys vs. secondary attributes; this is DataJoint's most important visual feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### UML Class Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** was designed for object-oriented programming but is sometimes adapted for database design:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510         \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n",
    "\u2502  Customer   \u25021       *\u2502   Order     \u2502\n",
    "\u2502\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2502\u25c6\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2502\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2502\n",
    "\u2502 customerId  \u2502         \u2502 orderId     \u2502\n",
    "\u2502 name        \u2502         \u2502 orderDate   \u2502\n",
    "\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518         \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Composition vs. aggregation**: UML uses filled vs. hollow diamonds to show ownership strength; DataJoint uses solid vs. dashed lines\n",
    "- **Object-oriented focus**: UML emphasizes inheritance and methods; DataJoint focuses purely on data relationships\n",
    "- **Multiplicity notation**: UML uses `1`, `*`, `0..1` at line ends; DataJoint uses line styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### DataJoint's Unique Features\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes DataJoint diagrams distinctive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Requirement**\n",
    "   - **No cycles allowed**: Foreign keys cannot form loops\n",
    "   - **Automatic layout**: All dependencies point in one direction (top-to-bottom)\n",
    "   - **Workflow interpretation**: Diagrams naturally represent operational sequences\n",
    "   - Other notations allow cycles (e.g., Employee \u2192 Department \u2192 Manager \u2192 Employee)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Line Style Encodes Semantic Information**\n",
    "   - **Thick solid**: Extension/specialization (one-to-one, shared identity)\n",
    "   - **Thin solid**: Containment/belonging (one-to-many, cascading identity)\n",
    "   - **Dashed**: Reference/association (one-to-many, independent identity)\n",
    "   - Other notations use line endpoints or labels, not line style itself\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Primary Key Cascade Visibility**\n",
    "   - **Solid lines** (thick or thin) mean parent's primary key becomes part of child's identity\n",
    "   - This is critical for understanding which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "   - No other notation makes this distinction visible\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Distinction Between Entities and Relationships**\n",
    "   - Association tables look like any other table\n",
    "   - Reflects reality: relationships often have attributes and can participate in other relationships\n",
    "   - Example: A `Synapse` table connecting neurons could be an entity (with properties) or a relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Underlined Names for Independent Entities**\n",
    "   - **Underlined**: Table has its own independent primary key (a \"dimension\")\n",
    "   - **Not underlined**: Table's primary key is inherited from parent (an \"extension\")\n",
    "   - Helps identify which tables are starting points vs. elaborations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Chen's ER | Crow's Foot | UML | DataJoint |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|-------------|-----|-----------|\n",

    "| **Identity Sharing** | Not indicated | Not indicated | Composition diamond | **Thick solid line** |\n",
    "| **Containment** | Not distinguished | Not distinguished | Aggregation diamond | **Thin solid line** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DataJoint's Approach Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The DAG constraint and line style notation are not just aesthetic choices\u2014they reflect a **design philosophy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schemas as Workflows**: Because there are no cycles, you can read any DataJoint schema as a sequence of operations or transformations. Start at the top (independent entities) and work your way down (derived results).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Simplicity**: Solid lines tell you which tables can be joined directly. If you can trace a path of solid lines between two tables, you can join them without including intermediate tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identity Semantics**: The line style immediately tells you whether entities share identity (thick), have contextualized identity (thin), or maintain independent identity (dashed).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Self-References**: The no-cycles rule means you never have a table with a foreign key to itself. Instead, you create association tables (like `ReportsTo` connecting employees to managers), which makes relationships explicit and queryable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Non-DataJoint Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "When you encounter schemas designed in other notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Look for cycles**: If present, you'll need to break them into association tables for DataJoint\n",
    "- **Identify many-to-many relationships**: These always need association tables in DataJoint (and in actual SQL)\n",
    "- **Check foreign key placement**: Determine whether they should be in primary keys (solid lines) or secondary attributes (dashed lines)\n",
    "- **Use `spawn_missing_classes()`**: DataJoint can automatically generate Python classes from existing MySQL/MariaDB databases"

    "### Comparing the Two Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "The MySQL tutorial ERD (above) and the DataJoint diagram (above) represent the same database, but there are significant visual and conceptual differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Direction and Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot (MySQL ERD)**:\n",
    "- No inherent direction\u2014tables are arranged for visual balance\n",
    "- Relationships flow in all directions (left, right, up, down)\n",
    "- Must read cardinality symbols at both ends of each line to understand relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint Diagram**:\n",
    "- Strict top-to-bottom flow (directed acyclic graph)\n",
    "- Dependencies always point downward (parent above, child below)\n",
    "- Can read the schema as a workflow from top to bottom\n",
    "- **Insight**: The vertical position tells you dependency order\u2014tables at the top can be populated first\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Cardinality Indication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot Notation**:\n",
    "- Uses symbols at line endpoints: `||` (one), `o` (zero/optional), `{` (many)\n",
    "- Example: `||\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500o{` means \"one to zero-or-many\"\n",
    "- Shows both sides of the relationship explicitly\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Makes optional relationships (nullable foreign keys) visible\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint Notation**:\n",
    "- Uses line thickness and style: thick solid, thin solid, dashed\n",
    "- Line style indicates whether foreign key is in primary key or not\n",
    "- Does **not** show nullable foreign keys (must check table definition)\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Line style conveys semantic meaning (extension vs. containment vs. reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Entity vs. Relationship Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot / Chen's ER**:\n",
    "- In Chen's notation, relationships are drawn as diamonds\n",
    "- Crow's Foot treats all tables uniformly but conceptually distinguishes entities from relationships\n",
    "- Many-to-many relationships are often shown with special notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **No distinction** between entity tables and association tables\u2014all are tables\n",
    "- Association tables (like `CustomerAccount`) look identical to entity tables\n",
    "- Recognize associations by their converging foreign key pattern\n",
    "- **Philosophy**: \"A synapse between neurons is both an entity (with properties) and a relationship (connecting neurons)\u2014why force a distinction?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Primary Key Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot**:\n",
    "- Does not visually distinguish between foreign keys in primary keys vs. secondary attributes\n",
    "- Cannot tell from the diagram whether you can join tables directly or need intermediate tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Solid lines** (thick or thin) mean foreign key is in primary key \u2192 primary key cascades\n",
    "- **Dashed lines** mean foreign key is secondary \u2192 no cascade\n",
    "- **Critical advantage**: You can see at a glance which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "- Example: If `A \u2192 B \u2192 C` are connected by solid lines, then `A * C` is a valid join\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Handling Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Notations**:\n",
    "- Allow cyclic relationships (e.g., Employee \u2192 Department \u2192 Manager \u2192 Employee)\n",
    "- Self-referencing tables are common (Employee table with manager_id field)\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **No cycles allowed**\u2014all schemas must be directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "- Self-referencing tables are avoided\n",
    "- Instead, use association tables: `Employee` \u2192 `ReportsTo` \u2192 `Employee` (renamed)\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Schemas can always be laid out top-to-bottom as workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Table Independence (Dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Notations**:\n",
    "- Don't visually distinguish between independent entities and dependent entities\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint**:\n",
    "- **Underlined table names**: Independent entities (dimensions) with their own primary key\n",
    "- **Non-underlined names**: Dependent entities whose primary key is inherited from parent\n",
    "- Helps identify which tables are \"starting points\" vs. \"elaborations\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Comparison Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple scenario: Customers placing Orders containing Items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot would show**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer ||\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500o{ Order o{\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|| OrderItem }o\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500|| Product\n",
    "   1              M         M              M           1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint shows**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer        Product\n",
    "    \u2502              \u2502\n",
    "    \u2502 (dashed)     \u2502 (dashed)\n",
    "    \u2193              \u2193\n",
    "  Order    \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n",
    "    \u2502 (thin solid)\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "OrderItem\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading the DataJoint diagram**:\n",
    "- Dashed lines to `Order`: Customer and Product references are secondary (Order has its own ID)\n",
    "- Thin solid line to `OrderItem`: Items belong to orders, identified as (order_id, item_number)\n",
    "- All solid lines point down: Top-to-bottom workflow (create customers/products, then orders, then items)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Each Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chen's ER Notation**:\n",
    "- \u2705 Clear conceptual modeling (entities vs. relationships explicit)\n",
    "- \u2705 Good for initial design discussions with non-technical stakeholders\n",
    "- \u274c Awkward for implementation (relationship diamonds don't map directly to tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crow's Foot Notation**:\n",
    "- \u2705 Shows nullable relationships clearly\n",
    "- \u2705 Explicit cardinality on both sides\n",
    "- \u2705 Widely recognized in industry\n",
    "- \u274c No directionality makes complex schemas harder to read\n",
    "- \u274c Doesn't show primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataJoint Notation**:\n",
    "- \u2705 Line style conveys semantic meaning (extension, containment, reference)\n",
    "- \u2705 Solid lines reveal which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "- \u2705 DAG structure makes schemas readable as workflows\n",
    "- \u2705 Underlined names identify independent entities\n",
    "- \u274c Nullable foreign keys not visible\n",
    "- \u274c Secondary unique constraints not visible\n",
    "- \u274c Less familiar to those trained in traditional notations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices: When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Chen's ER** for: Initial conceptual modeling with stakeholders\n",
    "- **Use Crow's Foot** for: Documentation of existing databases, focusing on cardinality\n",
    "- **Use DataJoint** for: Scientific workflows, hierarchical data, when query patterns matter\n",
    "- **Use UML** for: Object-relational mapping in application development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting Between Notations\n",
    "\n",
    "When converting from Crow's Foot or ER diagrams to DataJoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify independent entities** \u2192 These become top-level tables (underlined)\n",
    "2. **Find many-to-many relationships** \u2192 Create association tables with both foreign keys in primary key\n",
    "3. **Determine foreign key placement**:\n",
    "   - Does child belong to parent? \u2192 Foreign key in primary key (solid line)\n",
    "   - Does child reference parent? \u2192 Foreign key in secondary attributes (dashed line)\n",
    "4. **Break any cycles** \u2192 Create association tables to maintain acyclic property\n",
    "5. **Check for self-references** \u2192 Replace with association tables using renamed foreign keys"

    "## Conceptual Design vs. Implementation: A Key Philosophical Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "Database design is traditionally taught as a **two-phase process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conceptual Design Phase**: Create ER diagrams to model entities and relationships\n",
    "2. **Implementation Phase**: Translate the conceptual model into SQL CREATE TABLE statements\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation reflects a workflow where design and implementation are distinct activities, often performed by different people or at different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Two-Phase Approach\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2 - Implementation** (Manual SQL):\n",

    "    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE course (\n",
    "    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id),\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course(course_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: If you later add a `grade` field to enrollment, you must:\n",
    "1. Update the SQL code\n",
    "2. Update the ER diagram manually\n",
    "3. Update all documentation\n",
    "4. Risk: Steps 2-3 often get skipped\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DataJoint Unified Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Definition** (Code + Diagram in one):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@schema\n",
    "class Student(dj.Manual):\n",
    "    definition = \"\"\"\n",
    "    student_id : int\n",

    "\n",
    "# Diagram is automatically generated\n",
    "dj.Diagram(schema)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: \n",
    "- Add `grade` field \u2192 Save file \u2192 Diagram updates automatically\n",
    "- **Impossible** for diagram to be out of sync with implementation\n",

    "3. **Continuous refinement**: Iterate on design as you learn more about your domain\n",
    "4. **Team collaboration**: Everyone works with the same code that generates diagrams\n",

    "# Generate diagram\n",
    "dj.Diagram(schema)  # Reflects actual database structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

   "source": "## Foreign Keys Always Reference Primary Keys\n\nDataJoint enforces a simplifying convention that distinguishes it from raw SQL and other database frameworks: **foreign keys always reference the primary key of the parent table**.\n\n### SQL's Flexibility vs. DataJoint's Constraint\n\n**In SQL**, foreign keys can reference any unique key (not just the primary key):\n\n```sql\n-- SQL allows this:\nCREATE TABLE employee (\n    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    ssn VARCHAR(11) UNIQUE,\n    name VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE access_log (\n    log_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    employee_ssn VARCHAR(11),  -- References SSN, not employee_id!\n    timestamp DATETIME,\n    FOREIGN KEY (employee_ssn) REFERENCES employee(ssn)\n);\n```\n\n**In DataJoint**, this is not allowed:\n\n```python\n# DataJoint only allows references to primary keys\n@schema\nclass Employee(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    employee_id : int\n    ---\n    ssn : varchar(11)\n    unique index(ssn)\n    name : varchar(100)\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass AccessLog(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    log_id : int\n    ---\n    -> Employee  # MUST reference employee_id (the primary key), not ssn\n    timestamp : datetime\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Why This Constraint?\n\nThis restriction provides several benefits:\n\n1. **Simplicity**: No ambiguity about what foreign keys reference\n2. **Consistency**: All relationships work the same way\n3. **Diagrammatic clarity**: Every edge in the diagram represents a primary key reference\n4. **Identity-based relationships**: Relationships are between entities (identified by primary keys), not between arbitrary attributes\n5. **Query optimization**: Primary keys always have indexes; other unique keys may not\n\n**Design principle**: If you need to reference a secondary unique key, that often indicates the entity should be redesigned with that key as the primary key, or the relationship should go through a different table.\n\n### Renamed Foreign Keys: When Names Don't Match\n\nMost of the time, foreign key attributes have the **same names** as the primary key attributes they reference:\n\n```python\n@schema\nclass Customer(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    customer_id : int    # Primary key\n    ---\n    name : varchar(100)\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass Order(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    order_id : int\n    ---\n    -> Customer          # Creates foreign key: customer_id \u2192 customer_id\n    order_date : date\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nIn `Order`, the foreign key attribute is automatically named `customer_id` (same as in `Customer`).\n\nHowever, sometimes you need **different names**. Common scenarios:\n\n1. **Multiple references to the same table** (e.g., presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons)\n2. **Semantic clarity** (e.g., `manager_id` instead of `employee_id` for a manager reference)\n3. **Avoiding name conflicts** (when two parents have identically named primary keys)\n\n### Renamed Foreign Keys Using `.proj()`\n\nDataJoint uses **projection** to rename foreign key attributes:\n\n```python\n@schema\nclass Neuron(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    neuron_id : int\n    ---\n    neuron_type : varchar(20)\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass Synapse(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    synapse_id : int\n    ---\n    -> Neuron.proj(presynaptic='neuron_id')   # Renames to 'presynaptic'\n    -> Neuron.proj(postsynaptic='neuron_id')  # Renames to 'postsynaptic'\n    strength : float\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n**What happens**:\n- Instead of creating `neuron_id`, creates `presynaptic` and `postsynaptic`\n- Both still reference the `neuron_id` primary key in the `Neuron` table\n- Allows two foreign keys from the same child to the same parent\n\n### Orange Dots in Diagrams: Visualizing Renamed References\n\nWhen foreign keys are renamed, DataJoint diagrams show them as **orange dots** (intermediate nodes):\n\n```\n        Neuron\n         /         /       (\u25cf)     (\u25cf)  \u2190 Orange dots represent renamed references\n     |       |\n     \u2193       \u2193\n      Synapse\n```\n\nThe orange dots indicate:\n- A **projection** has been applied to rename the foreign key\n- The actual foreign key attribute name differs from the parent's primary key name\n- Multiple edges can connect the same pair of tables\n\n**In the actual diagram**, hovering over the orange dot reveals:\n- The parent table being referenced (`Neuron`)\n- The projection expression (e.g., `presynaptic='neuron_id'`)\n- The renamed attribute name\n\n### Multiple Edges Between Tables\n\nThis naming mechanism enables **multigraphs**\u2014where two tables can be connected by multiple distinct foreign keys:\n\n#### Example 1: Neural Connectivity\n\n```python\n@schema\nclass Neuron(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    neuron_id : int\n    ---\n    layer : int\n    neuron_type : enum('excitatory', 'inhibitory')\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass Synapse(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    synapse_id : int\n    ---\n    -> Neuron.proj(presynaptic='neuron_id')\n    -> Neuron.proj(postsynaptic='neuron_id')\n    strength : float\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nResult: Two foreign keys from `Synapse` to `Neuron`, creating a directed graph of neural connections.\n\n#### Example 2: Employee Reporting Structure\n\n```python\n@schema\nclass Employee(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    employee_id : int\n    ---\n    name : varchar(100)\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass ReportsTo(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    -> Employee                              # subordinate\n    ---\n    -> Employee.proj(manager_id='employee_id')  # manager\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nResult: Two foreign keys from `ReportsTo` to `Employee`, representing the management hierarchy.\n\n#### Example 3: Flight Routes\n\n```python\n@schema\nclass Airport(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    airport_code : char(3)\n    ---\n    airport_name : varchar(100)\n    city : varchar(50)\n    \"\"\"\n\n@schema\nclass Flight(dj.Manual):\n    definition = \"\"\"\n    flight_number : varchar(10)\n    ---\n    -> Airport.proj(origin='airport_code')\n    -> Airport.proj(destination='airport_code')\n    departure_time : time\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nResult: Two foreign keys from `Flight` to `Airport`, representing origin and destination.\n\n### When to Use Renamed Foreign Keys\n\n**Use renamed foreign keys when**:\n- \u2705 You need multiple references to the same parent table\n- \u2705 The semantic role of the reference is important (presynaptic vs. postsynaptic)\n- \u2705 You want to avoid name conflicts\n- \u2705 The relationship is self-referential (table references itself indirectly)\n\n**Avoid renaming when**:\n- \u274c There's only one reference to the parent\n- \u274c The default name is clear and unambiguous\n- \u274c Simpler is better\u2014don't rename unnecessarily\n\n### Understanding Orange Dots in Diagrams\n\nWhen you see orange dots in a DataJoint diagram:\n\n1. **Count the dots**: Each dot represents a renamed foreign key reference\n2. **Follow the path**: Dot connects the child table to the parent through a renamed projection\n3. **Check for multiple edges**: If you see multiple orange dots connecting the same tables, those are multiple distinct foreign keys\n4. **Hover for details**: In interactive diagrams, hovering reveals the projection expression\n\n**Visual interpretation**:\n```\nTable A\n  |\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500 (\u25cf) \u2500\u2500\u2192 Table B  (first foreign key, renamed)\n  |\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500 (\u25cf) \u2500\u2500\u2192 Table B  (second foreign key, renamed)\n```\n\nThis means Table A has two different foreign keys both referencing Table B's primary key, but with different attribute names.\n\n### Comparison to Other Notations\n\n| Feature | SQL (Standard) | Traditional ERD | DataJoint |\n|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| **FK can reference** | Any unique key | Any unique key | Primary key only |\n| **Renamed FK** | Column name differs | Not standardized | `.proj()` syntax |\n| **Multiple FK to same table** | Yes | Yes, but notation varies | Yes, via orange dots |\n| **Self-referencing** | Common (FK to own table) | Shown as loop | Avoided; use association table |\n| **Visual indication of rename** | N/A | Not standard | Orange dot nodes |\n\n### Design Patterns with Renamed Foreign Keys\n\nRenamed foreign keys are essential for several common patterns:\n\n**Pattern 1: Directed Graphs**\n- Nodes: Single table (Neuron, Person, Airport)\n- Edges: Association table with two renamed FKs to the same parent\n- Use: Neural networks, social networks, transportation networks\n\n**Pattern 2: Hierarchical Relationships**\n- Parent/child in same table type (Employee \u2192 Manager, Category \u2192 ParentCategory)\n- Association table connects with renamed references\n\n**Pattern 3: Comparison Tables**\n- Comparing entities of the same type\n- Example: ProductComparison with product_a and product_b both referencing Product\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nDataJoint's convention of **foreign keys always referencing primary keys** simplifies the conceptual model. When you see an edge in a DataJoint diagram, you know it represents a primary key reference. \n\nWhen you see **orange dots**, you know:\n- Foreign key attributes are renamed for clarity or necessity\n- Multiple relationships may exist between the same tables\n- The diagram explicitly shows these special cases\n\nThis makes DataJoint diagrams both simpler (one type of reference) and more expressive (orange dots highlight special relationships) than traditional notations."

    "# Understanding Line Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important feature of DataJoint diagrams is how **line styles indicate relationship types**. There are three types of lines, each conveying specific information about how tables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Three Line Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Thick Solid Line (\u2501\u2501\u2501)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: One-to-one relationship where the foreign key constitutes the **entire primary key** of the child table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Model**: The child entity is a **specialized extension or elaboration** of the parent entity. The child doesn't have its own independent identity\u2014it IS the parent, just with additional information attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Child table shares the exact same primary key as the parent\n",
    "- Creates the strongest form of dependency and unified identity\n",
    "- Child inherits the parent's complete identity\n",
    "- Perfect for adding optional or modular information to an entity\n",
    "- Enables direct joins across multiple levels of hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "- Workflow sequences: Order \u2192 Shipment \u2192 Delivery (each step extends the order)\n",

    "\n",
    "\u274c **Nullable Foreign Keys**:\n",

    "# Practical Tips for Working with Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Read a Schema Quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "When encountering a new schema diagram, follow this systematic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Independent Entities** (top of diagram, underlined)\n",
    "   - These are your starting points for data entry\n",
    "   - No dependencies on other tables\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Trace the Solid Lines** (thick or thin)\n",
    "   - Follow the cascading primary keys\n",
    "   - Understand which tables can be joined directly\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Spot Association Tables** (converging patterns)\n",
    "   - Look for tables with multiple foreign keys in their primary key\n",
    "   - These represent many-to-many relationships\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Check Line Thickness**\n",
    "   - Thick lines = one-to-one relationships (workflow steps, optional extensions)\n",
    "   - Thin lines = one-to-many hierarchies (ownership, containment)\n",
    "   - Dashed lines = one-to-many loose associations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing with Diagrams in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a new schema, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Solid Lines When**:\n",
    "- Building hierarchical structures (Study \u2192 Subject \u2192 Session)\n",
    "- Creating workflow sequences (Order \u2192 Ship \u2192 Deliver)\n",
    "- You want to enable direct joins across levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Dashed Lines When**:\n",
    "- Child has independent identity from parent\n",
    "- Relationship might change frequently\n",
    "- You don't want primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Thick Lines When**:\n",
    "- Creating one-to-one relationships\n",
    "- Extending entities with optional information\n",
    "- Modeling sequential workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagram-Driven Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram structure directly informs query patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solid Line Paths** (direct joins possible):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study \u2192 Subject \u2192 Session are connected by solid lines:\n",
    "Study * Session  # Valid join, no need to include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dashed Line Paths** (must include intermediate tables):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If Study ---> Subject (dashed), Subject \u2192 Session (solid):\n",
    "Study * Subject * Session  # Must include Subject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns at a Glance\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Line Type | Primary Key Structure | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Independent entities | None (top level) | Own PK | Starting points |\n",
    "| Hierarchy | Thin solid | Parent PK + own field(s) | Containment, ownership |\n",
    "| Sequence | Thick solid | Parent PK only | Workflows, one-to-one |\n",
    "| Secondary reference | Dashed | Own PK | Association |\n",
    "| Association table | Multiple thin solid | Multiple parent PKs | Many-to-many |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Jupyter Notebooks**:\n",
    "- **Hover** over tables to see complete definitions (also works if you save the diagram as a SVG file)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering Diagrams**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Show only specific tables\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + dj.Diagram(Table2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate dependencies\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and its immediate up to seven layears up in the graph\n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) - 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show table and what depends on it  \n",
    "dj.Diagram(Table1) + 1\n",

    "- **Understanding** existing schemas quickly\n",
    "- **Communicating** design decisions visually\n",
    "- **Planning** query strategies\n",
    "- **Validating** relationship structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is understanding that **line style encodes relationship semantics**: thick solid lines for one-to-one, thin solid lines for cascading one-to-many, and dashed lines for non-cascading one-to-many relationships. This visual language makes complex schemas comprehensible at a glance.\n"
