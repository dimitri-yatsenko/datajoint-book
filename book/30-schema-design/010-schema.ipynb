    "## What is a schema?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the word \"schema\" in a couple of different but related ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a **schema** is a formal specification of the data structure and of the rules governing its integrity.\n",
    "The schema serves as a blueprint that defines how data is organized, stored, and accessed within the database, ensuring that the data reflects the underlying business or research project rules it supports.\n",
    "In strucuted data models, such as the relational model, schemas \n",
    "In the relational data model, the schema provides a robust framework for defining the rules and constraints that govern data operations, helping to maintain consistency, accuracy, and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to ensuring data integrity, good schema design optimizes the ease and efficiency of data queries. \n",
    "A well-designed schema facilitates fast and accurate data retrieval, supports more complex queries, and allows the database to scale as data volumes grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational schema design involves defining a set of tables, each with columns (attributes) of specific data types. These tables are linked by primary keys, which uniquely identify each record, and foreign keys, which establish relationships between entities in different tables. Additional constraints, such as uniqueness constraints and indexes, further refine the schema by enforcing rules that prevent data duplication and by improving query performance. Default values can also be specified for certain attributes, ensuring that missing or optional data is handled consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through schema design, database architects ensure that the database not only meets the current needs of the organization but also remains flexible and scalable as those needs evolve. The schema acts as a living document that guides the databaseâ€™s structure, supports efficient data operations, and upholds the integrity of the data it manages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DataJoint, declaring individual tables is the foundational step in building your data pipeline. Each table corresponds to a specific entity or data structure that you want to model within your database. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of declaring individual tables, covering essential components like primary keys, attributes, and basic definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second meaning of the word \"schema\" is for a single module in a complex database design. \n",
    "Complex databases can be separated into modules that serve as namespaces for related tables.\n",
    "Thus a database may comprise multiple schemas.\n",
    "We discuss multi-schema designs in a separate section."

    "# Attribute Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint uses data types provided by its underlying database management system, MySQL. \n",
    "DataJoint also provides its own data types, which we will introduce later.\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL, one of the most popular relational database management systems, supports a variety of data types that are used to define the kind of data that can be stored in a table's columns. Choosing the correct data type is crucial for optimizing performance, storage, and ensuring the accuracy of the data. This section provides an overview of the main MySQL data types, categorized into numeric types, date and time types, string (or character) types, and other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn about the full set of MySQL datatypes in the [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/data-types.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we only list the datatypes commonly used in DataJoint. We will only use these datatypes in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types are used to store numbers. They are divided into integer types, floating-point types, and fixed-point types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer Types**:\n",
    "  - `TINYINT`: A very small integer. Range: -128 to 127 or 0 to 255 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  - `SMALLINT`: A small integer. Range: -32,768 to 32,767 or 0 to 65,535 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  - `INT`: A standard integer. Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or 0 to 4,294,967,295 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  - `BIGINT`: A large integer. Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 or 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (if `UNSIGNED`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Each of these types can be specified as `UNSIGNED` to allow only non-negative values, effectively doubling the upper limit of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Floating-Point Types**:\n",
    "  - `FLOAT`: A floating-point number with M digits in total and D digits after the decimal point. Approximate range is -3.402823466E+38 to 3.402823466E+38.\n",
    "  - `DOUBLE`: A double-precision floating-point number. Approximate range is -1.7976931348623157E+308 to 1.7976931348623157E+308.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed-Point Types**:\n",
    "  - `DECIMAL(M,D)`: A fixed-point number where M is the total number of digits and D is the number of digits after the decimal point. This type is used for exact numeric data (e.g., for monetary values). It can be marked `UNSIGNED` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Date and Time Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Date and time data types are used to store temporal data. These types are essential for tracking dates, times, and intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DATE`: A date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. The range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.\n",
    "- `DATETIME`: A combination of date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. The range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.\n",
    "- `TIMESTAMP`: A timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, representing the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). The range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC.\n",
    "- `TIME`: A time value in the format `HH:MM:SS`. The range is from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'.\n",
    "- `YEAR`: A year in 2-digit or 4-digit format. The range is from '1901' to '2155' for 4-digit format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## String (Character) Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "String data types are used to store text and binary data. These types are flexible and can store anything from a single character to large text blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CHAR(M)`: A fixed-length string that is always padded with spaces to the specified length M. The maximum length is 255 characters.\n",
    "- `VARCHAR(M)`: A variable-length string where M specifies the maximum length. The maximum length is 65,535 characters.\n",
    "- `ENUM`: An enumeration. You can specify a list of permitted values, and the column can store only one of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the correct data type for each column in your table is crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Choose data types that use the least amount of storage while accommodating all possible values. For instance, if you only need to store small numbers, use `TINYINT` instead of `INT`.\n",
    "- **Precision**: Use `DECIMAL` for precise calculations, especially for financial data, instead of `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE`, which are subject to rounding errors.\n",
    "- **Appropriateness**: Match the data type to the nature of the data. For example, use `DATE` for date values, `CHAR` for fixed-length fields like postal codes, and `TEXT` for large text blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding MySQL data types is essential for designing efficient, reliable, and maintainable databases. By choosing the appropriate data types for your columns, you ensure that your database performs well and stores data accurately. This overview provides a solid foundation for selecting the right data types when defining your tables in MySQL.\n"

    "\n",
    "Dropping a schema in DataJoint involves permanently deleting all the tables within that schema and the schema itself from the database. This is a significant action because it removes not only the tables but also all the data stored within those tables. To drop a schema, you typically use the `schema.drop()` method, where schema is the schema object you defined earlier in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute this command, DataJoint will prompt you to confirm the action, as it is irreversible and will result in the loss of all data associated with the schema. This operation is especially powerful because it cascades through all tables within the schema, removing each one. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to ensure that any data within the schema is either no longer needed or has been adequately backed up before dropping the schema, as this action will permanently remove all traces of the data and the schemaâ€™s structure from the database."
