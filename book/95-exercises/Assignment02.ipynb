    "Design database tables to represent the followig entities. Make sure that each table has a proper primary key. Populate each table with several entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You manage a pet clinic. Design a table for the pets treated in your clinic. For identifying animals, use the [US National Animal Identification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Animal_Identification_System). Include name, species, date of birth, and sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now represent the veterinarians in your clinic, including name, highest degree attained, date-of-birth, and hire date.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. US States and Territories, including their capitals, and the year of acceptance into the USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Current members of the [US House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/representatives). Include state, district, name, party, and phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Current [US governors](https://www.nga.org/governors/).\n",

    "6. Your homework assignments for this semester, including the course and the due date.\n",

    "7. Students in this class, including names, github accounts, and emails.\n",

    "8. [Boston Marathon champions](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/results/champions) for each year for both men's and women's open division. Include name, nationality, and finish time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment will be evaluated on proper design. Choose correct and sufficient attributes, data types, primary key, NOT NULL constraints. Answer the question of how entity integrity will be enforced. Avoid unnecessary attributes. Sample data must be propery inserted, at least 2-3 entries in each table."
