    "\n",
    "Schema diagrams are essential tools for understanding and designing DataJoint pipelines.\n",
    "They provide a visual representation of tables and their dependencies, making complex workflows comprehensible at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As introduced in [Relational Workflows](../20-concepts/05-workflows.md), DataJoint schemas form **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent tables (workflow steps)\n",
    "- **Edges** represent foreign key dependencies\n",
    "- **Direction** flows from parent (referenced) to child (referencing) tables\n",

    "This DAG structure embodies a core principle of the Relational Workflow Model: **the schema is an executable specification**.\n",
    "Tables at the top are independent entities; tables below depend on tables above them.\n",
    "Reading the diagram top-to-bottom reveals the workflow execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint's diagramming notation differs from traditional notations (Chen's ER, Crow's Foot, UML) in one critical way: **line styles encode semantic relationship types**, not just cardinality.\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start at the top**: Identify independent entities (underlined)\n",
    "2. **Follow solid lines**: Trace primary key cascades downward\n",
    "3. **Spot convergence patterns**: Multiple lines into a table indicate associations\n",
    "4. **Check line thickness**: Thick = one-to-one, Thin = one-to-many containment\n",
    "5. **Note dashed lines**: These don't cascade identity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing with Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose solid lines when**:\n",
    "   - Building hierarchies (Study → Subject → Session)\n",
    "   - Creating workflow sequences (Order → Ship → Deliver)\n",
    "   - You want direct joins across levels\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose dashed lines when**:\n",
    "   - Child has independent identity from parent\n",
    "   - Reference might change or is optional\n",
    "   - You don't need primary key cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose thick lines when**:\n",
    "   - Extending entities with optional information\n",
    "   - Modeling workflow steps (one output per input)\n",
    "   - Creating one-to-one relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hover over tables** to see complete definitions (works in Jupyter and SVG exports)\n",
    "- **Hover over orange dots** to see projection expressions\n",
    "- **Use `+` and `-` operators** to focus on specific parts of large schemas"
