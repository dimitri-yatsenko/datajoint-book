    "```{card} Relationship Building Blocks\n",
    "**Foreign keys** establish connections between tables:\n",
    "- A foreign key in the child references the primary key of the parent\n",
    "- The parent side always has cardinality of exactly **one**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniqueness constraints** determine cardinality on the child side:\n",
    "- No constraint on foreign key: **many** children per parent (one-to-many)\n",
    "- Unique constraint on foreign key: **one** child per parent (one-to-one)\n",
