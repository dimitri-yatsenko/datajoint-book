Orchestration is solved through complementary infrastructure.\n\n## The Orchestration Challenge\n\nA typical DataJoint workflow requires:\n\n1. **Database server** — MySQL/MariaDB instance with appropriate configuration\n2. **Worker processes** — Python environments with DataJoint and domain-specific packages\n3. **File storage** — For external blob storage (if using `dj.config['stores']`)\n4. **Job coordination** — Managing which workers process which jobs\n5. **Error handling** — Retrying failed jobs, alerting on persistent failures\n6. **Scaling** — Adding workers during high-demand periods\n\nThe `populate(reserve_jobs=True)` option handles job coordination at the database level, but provisioning and managing the workers themselves requires additional infrastructure.\n\n## Commercial Solution: DataJoint Platform\n\n[DataJoint Platform](https://datajoint.com) is a managed platform that provides comprehensive orchestration:\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Managed databases** | Provisioned and configured MySQL instances |\n| **Container registry** | Store and version workflow container images |\n| **Compute clusters** | Auto-scaling worker pools (cloud or on-premise) |\n| **Job scheduler** | Automated triggering of `populate` operations |\n| **Monitoring dashboard** | Real-time visibility into job status and errors |\n| **Cost analytics** | Track compute and storage costs per workflow |\n\nThis platform integrates directly with DataJoint schemas, providing a turnkey solution for teams that prefer managed infrastructure.\n\n## DIY Solutions\n\nMany teams build custom orchestration using standard DevOps tools. Common approaches include:\n\n### Containerization\n\n- **Docker** — Package DataJoint workflows with all dependencies\n- **Singularity/Apptainer** — Container runtime for HPC environments\n- **Conda environments** — Dependency management without full containerization\n\n### Container Orchestration\n\n- **Kubernetes** — Production-grade container orchestration\n- **Docker Swarm** — Simpler container clustering\n- **Nomad** — HashiCorp's workload orchestrator\n\n### Job Schedulers\n\n- **SLURM** — Common in academic HPC clusters\n- **PBS/Torque** — Traditional batch scheduling\n- **HTCondor** — High-throughput computing scheduler\n- **Apache Airflow** — DAG-based workflow orchestration\n- **Prefect** — Modern Python-native orchestration\n- **Celery** — Distributed task queue\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure\n\n- **AWS Batch** — Managed batch computing on AWS\n- **Google Cloud Run Jobs** — Serverless container execution\n- **Azure Container Instances** — On-demand container execution\n\n### Monitoring and Observability\n\n- **Prometheus + Grafana** — Metrics collection and visualization\n- **DataDog** — Commercial observability platform\n- **CloudWatch / Stackdriver** — Cloud-native monitoring\n\n### Database Hosting\n\n- **Amazon RDS** — Managed MySQL on AWS\n- **Google Cloud SQL** — Managed MySQL on GCP\n- **Self-hosted MySQL/MariaDB** — On-premise or VM-based\n\n## Choosing an Approach\n\nThe right orchestration strategy depends on your team's context:\n\n| Factor | Managed Platform | DIY |\n|--------|-----------------|-----|\n| **Setup time** | Hours | Days to weeks |\n| **Maintenance** | Included | Team responsibility |\n| **Customization** | Platform constraints | Full flexibility |\n| **Cost model** | Subscription | Infrastructure costs |\n| **Existing infrastructure** | May duplicate | Leverages investments |\n| **Compliance requirements** | Check with vendor | Full control |\n\nMany teams start with DIY solutions using familiar tools, then evaluate managed platforms as workflows scale and operational overhead increases.\n\n:::{seealso}\n- [DataJoint Platform](https://datajoint.com) — Managed orchestration platform\n- [Populate](050-populate.ipynb) — The underlying automation mechanism\n:::"
